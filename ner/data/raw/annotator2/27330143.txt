Maternal weight status, diet, and supplement use as determinants of breastfeeding and complementary feeding: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
CONTEXT: Infant feeding practices are influenced by maternal factors. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review is to examine the associations between maternal weight status or dietary characteristics and breastfeeding or complementary feeding. DATA SOURCES: A systematic literature search of the Embase, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, MEDLINE, PubMed, and Web of Science databases was performed. STUDY SELECTION: Interventional and cohort studies in healthy mothers and infants that reported on maternal weight status, diet, or supplement use were selected. DATA EXTRACTION: Outcomes assessed included delayed onset of lactogenesis; initiation, exclusivity, duration, and cessation of breastfeeding; and timing of complementary feeding. DATA ANALYSIS: Eighty-one studies were included. Maternal underweight, diet, and supplement use were not associated with infant feeding practices. Obese women had a relative risk of failure to initiate breastfeeding (risk ratio [RR] = 1.23; 95%CI, 1.03-1.47) and a delayed onset of lactogenesis (RR  =  2.06; 95%CI, 1.18-3.61). The RR for breastfeeding cessation was 1.11 (95%CI, 1.07-1.15) per increase in category of body mass index. CONCLUSIONS: Prevention of obesity in women of reproductive age, as well as counseling of obese women after delivery, could be targeted to improve infant feeding practices.
