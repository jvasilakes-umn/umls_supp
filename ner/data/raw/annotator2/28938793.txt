Effects of protein or amino-acid supplementation on the physical growth of young children in low-income countries.
Child growth stunting is common in low-income countries, possibly due to insufficient protein intakes. Most previous studies have concluded that children's protein intakes are adequate in relation to estimated requirements, but these studies did not consider issues of protein digestibility and effects of infection on dietary protein utilization. Using an alternative approach to assess the possible role of protein inadequacy in children's growth restriction, the results of 18 intervention trials in which supplementary protein or amino acids were provided to children ages 6-35 months and growth outcomes were reviewed. Eight studies conducted in hospitalized children recovering from acute malnutrition found that the recommended protein intake levels for healthy children supported normal growth rates, but higher intakes were needed for accelerated rates of "catch-up" growth. Ten community-based studies did not demonstrate a consistent benefit of supplemental protein on children's growth. However, weaknesses in the study designs limit the conclusions that can be drawn from these studies, and additional appropriately designed trials are needed to answer this question definitively. Recommendations for optimizing future study designs are provided herein.
