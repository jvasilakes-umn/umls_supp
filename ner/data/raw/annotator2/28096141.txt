The Role of the Novel Lipokine Palmitoleic Acid in Health and Disease.
The monounsaturated fatty acid palmitoleate (palmitoleic acid) is one of the most abundant fatty acids in serum and tissues, particularly adipose tissue and liver. Its endogenous production by stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 gives rise to its cis isoform, cis-palmitoleate. Although trans-palmitoleate is also synthesized in humans, it is mainly found as an exogenous source in ruminant fat and dairy products. Recently, palmitoleate was considered to be a lipokine based on evidence demonstrating its release from adipose tissue and its metabolic effects on distant organs. After this finding, research has been performed to determine whether palmitoleate has beneficial effects on metabolism and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Thus, the aim of this work was to review the current status of knowledge about palmitoleate, its metabolism, and its influence on metabolic abnormalities. Results have shown mixed cardiovascular effects, direct or inverse correlations with obesity, and hepatosteatosis, but a significant amelioration or prevention of insulin resistance and diabetes. Finally, the induction of palmitoleate release from adipose tissue, dietary intake, and its supplementation are all interventions with a potential impact on certain metabolic diseases.
