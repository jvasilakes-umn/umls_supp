Seafood allergen-induced hypersensitivity at the microbiota-mucosal site: Implications for prospective probiotic use in allergic response regulation.
Food allergy is a serious disease worldwide; it can significantly lower the standard of living of affected individuals and may be life-threatening. In particular, hypersensitivity to seafood has been increasing in recent years owing to rising consumption. The mucosal immune system plays a critical role in the onset of seafood allergy and other allergic diseases. Recently, experimental and clinical evidence has shown that probiotics significantly modulate immune responses and thus suppress allergic reactions. Therefore, in this review, we summarized the basic knowledge of seafood allergy, the mucosal immune system, and probiotic activities. We also reviewed the critical immune factors involved in allergic reactions, as well as the potential mechanism and the potential use of probiotics to ameliorate seafood allergy. The elucidation of these topics may help us to develop preventive and therapeutic approaches for seafood allergy and other immune disorders in the future.
