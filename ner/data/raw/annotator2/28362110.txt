Diet effects in the asthma treatment: A systematic review.
INTRODUCTION: Obesity in asthmatic patients has important relationships with asthma control, pulmonary function, and quality of life. The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review of the literature on the effect of diet on asthma management in adults. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, and Scopus (January 1948-October 2014) for randomized clinical trials that evaluated the effects of diet in adults with asthma. RESULTS: Of 12,215 studies identified, 21 were included. A reduction in weight of at least 7.5% from baseline as a result of caloric restriction can be beneficial for improving disease control, quality of life, and pulmonary function in obese patients with asthma. A dietary pattern rich in foods with potential antioxidant effect had an impact in improving asthma control, but with little clinical significance. Studies involving antioxidant supplementation showed improvements in asthma control with magnesium supplementation and less decline in lung function with vitamin C supplementation. Studies of fatty acid supplementation demonstrated effects on weight loss and improvement of asthma control and lung function. Studies of supplementation with propolis and caffeine reported significant increases in FEV1. Conversely, studies of high dietary salt intake reported greater declines in lung function. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence shows that, for obese adults with asthma, the best dietary intervention seems to be caloric restriction, regardless of specific dietary components.
