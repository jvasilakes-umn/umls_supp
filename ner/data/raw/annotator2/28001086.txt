Bioactive whey peptide particles: An emerging class of nutraceutical carriers.
Whey-based diets have been linked with prolonged life expectancy and improved physical performance. These observations based on numerous clinical and simulated studies are attributed to diverse biological activities of whey peptides. Recently, bioactive whey peptides were exploited for enveloping nutraceuticals and drugs in view of fabricating capsules that the carrier matrix is also bioactive. Some of the most considered bioactivities of whey peptides including antihypertension, antioxidant, anti-obesity, anti-diabetes, and hypocholesterolemic properties with corresponding underlying mechanisms are briefly discussed. Then, we overview the supramolecular and gelation-prompted encapsulation of nutraceuticals with whey proteins, followed by summarizing recent developments in utilization of synthetic peptides for gene and drug delivery. Finally, particulation of bioactive whey peptides are communicated. Whey peptides may exert both biologically beneficial and technologically appreciated activities. Two procedures including desolvation and internal gelation have been so far employed for bioactive peptides particulation. Crosslinking is a prerequisite to confer acid-induced cold-set gelation to bioactive peptides. It also increases peptides Fe3+-reducing power. Surface activity of a population of peptides in whey protein hydrolysate may result in co-adsorption of the peptides together with small molecule surfactants onto oil-water interface, leading to modulated interfacial architecture and particle morphology.
