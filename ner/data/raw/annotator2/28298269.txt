Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease, the Gut Microbiome, and Diet.
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common liver disorder in the world, yet the pathogenesis of the disease is not well elucidated. Due to the close anatomic and functional association between the intestinal lumen and the liver through the portal system, it is speculated that the gut microbiome may play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. Furthermore, diet, which can modulate the gut microbiome and several metabolic pathways involved in NAFLD development, shows a potential tripartite relation between the gut, diet, and the liver. In this review, we summarize the current evidence that supports the association between NAFLD, the gut microbiome, and the role of diet.
