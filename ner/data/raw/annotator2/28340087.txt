Nutrigenomic point of view on effects and mechanisms of action of ruminant trans fatty acids on insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.
Evidence from observational studies suggests beneficial effects of ruminant trans fatty acids (rTFA) on insulin resistance (IR) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, beneficial effects of rTFA are not always observed in cell, animal, and human studies. This narrative review presents potential mechanisms of action of rTFA using nutrigenomics and microRNA results in an integrative model. In addition, the review presents factors, including measures of IR and T2D, dose and duration of studies, as well as health status, ethnicity, and genotypes of subjects, that may help explain the heterogeneity in response to rTFA supplementation. Future studies should consider these factors, as well as research in nutritional genomics, to better understand the effects of rTFA on IR and T2D.
