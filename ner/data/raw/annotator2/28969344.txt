Methodological approach to moving nutritional science evidence into practice.
The Metabolically Optimized Brain study explored nutritional science believed to be ready to place into practice to help improve US service members' cognitive performance and, thereby, optimize mission-readiness. A transparent, step-wise, research approach was used for informing evidence-based decisions among and for various, diverse stakeholders. A steering committee and subject-matter experts convened to devise the protocol and independent systematic reviews were performed to determine the quality of the evidence for nutritional science in 4 areas relevant to military populations: (1) caffeinated foods and beverages; (2) omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids; (3) plant-based foods and beverages or their phytochemical constituents; and (4) whole dietary patterns. A research expert panel was asked to then recommend future research directions and solutions likely to benefit warfighters. An implementation expert panel further considered how to apply sound nutritional science in a cost-effective manner. This article summarizes the methodological processes, high-level results, global research recommendations, and priorities for implementation. Specific results of the individual dietary interventions, as well as recommendations for moving this field of research and practice forward, are detailed throughout the current supplement.
