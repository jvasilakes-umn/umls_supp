Therapeutic and nutraceutical potential of rosmarinic acid-Cytoprotective properties and pharmacokinetic profile.
Rosmarinic acid (RA) is a natural polyphenolic antioxidant derived from many common herbal plants. This compound displays several important biological properties, including anti-inflammatory, antiviral, antibacterial, antidepressant, anticarcionogenic, and chemopreventive properties. The importance of its activities and its possible application in processed foods as a natural antioxidant has reached a new interest levels in recent years. The health effects of this polyphenol depend greatly on both its intakes and bioavailability. This review focuses on the importance of RA as a dietary supplement, and summarizes its pharmacokinetics and metabolism, including the factors that limit its oral bioavailability which leads to a lower therapeutic action. Further experimental investigations are needed to optimize and enhance the oral bioavailability of this natural compound which consequently will help increasing therapeutic efficacy of RA in vivo.
