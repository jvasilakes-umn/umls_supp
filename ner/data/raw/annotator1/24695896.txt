Dietary calcium does not interact with vitamin D₃ in terms of determining the response and catabolism of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D during winter in older adults.
BACKGROUND: Interactions between calcium and vitamin D may have implications for the regulation of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and its catabolism and, consequently, the vitamin D dietary requirement. OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether different calcium intakes influenced serum 25(OH)D and indexes of vitamin D activation and catabolism during winter and in the context of both adequate and inadequate vitamin D intakes. DESIGN: A 15-wk winter-based, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind vitamin D₃ intervention (20 μg/d) study was carried out in free-living men and women aged ≥50 y (n = 125) who were stratified according to calcium intakes [moderate-low (<700 mg/d) or high (>1000 mg/d) intake]. The serum 25(OH)D concentration was the primary outcome, and serum calcium, parathyroid hormone (PTH), 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)₂D], 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [24,25(OH)₂D], the ratio of 24,25(OH)₂D to 25(OH)D, vitamin D-binding protein, and free 25(OH)D were exploratory outcomes. RESULTS: A repeated-measures ANOVA showed there was no significant (P = 0.2) time × vitamin D treatment × calcium intake grouping interaction effect on the mean serum 25(OH)D concentration over the 15-wk intervention period. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations increased (P ≤ 0.005) and decreased (P ≤ 0.002) in vitamin D₃ and placebo groups, respectively, and were of similar magnitudes in subjects with calcium intakes <700 mg/d (and even <550 mg/d) compared with >1000 mg/d. The response of serum PTH, 1,25(OH)₂D, 24,25(OH)₂D, the ratio of 24,25(OH)₂D to 25(OH)D, and free 25(OH)D significantly differed in vitamin D₃ and placebo groups but not by calcium intake grouping. CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence of a vitamin D sparing effect of high calcium intake, which has been referred to by some authors as "vitamin D economy." Thus, recent dietary vitamin D requirement estimates will cover the vitamin D needs of even those individuals who have inadequate calcium intakes.
