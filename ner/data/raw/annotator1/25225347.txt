Modulation of the gut microbiota by nutrients with prebiotic and probiotic properties.
Experimental data in animals, but also observational studies in humans, suggest that the composition of the gut microbiota differs in obese vs. lean individuals, in patients with vs. without diabetes, or in patients presenting other diseases associated with obesity or nutritional disbalance, such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) or cardiovascular diseases. In this review, we describe how changes in the composition and/or activity of the gut microbiota by administration of nutrients with probiotic or prebiotic properties can modulate host gene expression and metabolism and thereby positively influence host adipose tissue development and related metabolic disorders.
