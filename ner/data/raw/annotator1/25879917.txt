Adhesion of Lactobacilli and their anti-infectivity potential.
The probiotic potential of lactic acid bacteria primarily point toward colonizing ability of Lactobacilli as the most important attribute for endowing all the known beneficial effects in a host. Lactobacillus species exert health-promoting function in the gastrointestinal tract through various mechanisms such as pathogen exclusion, maintenance of microbial balance, immunomodulation, and other crucial functions. It has been seen that many surface layer proteins are involved in host adhesion, and play significant role in the modification of some signaling pathways within the host cells. Interaction between different bacterial cell surface proteins and host receptor has been imperative for a better understanding of the mechanism through which Lactobacilli exert their health-promoting functions.
