Isolation and analysis of bioactive compounds in Capsicum peppers.
An overview of the state of the art in the extraction, isolation, and analytical determination of bioactive compounds in peppers of the genus Capsicum is presented. The review is structured by classes of phytochemicals. Both major and minor constituents of peppers are considered. Modern trends in analytical chemistry of nutrients in regard to pepper analysis with particular focus on chromatographic and related methods are discussed. Attention was paid to controversial questions of pepper analysis, including but not limited to problems of sample degradation and the completeness of extraction of target analytes. The rationale for choosing an optimal strategy of analysis is given.
