Nanodelivery: An Emerging Avenue for Nutraceuticals and Drug Delivery.
Aquaculture has been globally recognized as the fastest growing food production sector which plays a major role in meeting the increasing demand for animal protein requirement. A consensus is growing that a dramatic increase in aquaculture is needed to supply future aquatic food needs. However, there are sustained problems with the aquaculture like disease outbreaks, chemical pollution, the environmental destruction, and inefficient feed utilization. These altogether raise question mark on sustainability of aquaculture. In spite of the several strategy adopted on national and international level, as improved laboratory facilities, diagnostic expertise, and control and therapeutic strategies in order to handle disease outbreaks more effectively. Aquaculture industry is under uncertainty and the progress has not matched that of the rapidly developing aquaculture sector. In order to control disease prevalence and ensure better health of system and sustainable production, the sector demand more technical innovation for the drug use, disease treatment, water quality management, production of tailored fish for suiting better health, productivity drive by epigenetic and nutrigenomic interaction, better breeding success by efficient delivery of maturation and spawning inducing agent, nutraceutical delivery for rapid growth promotion and culture time reduction, successful use of autotransgenic, and effective vaccine. Nanotechnology has a tremendous potential to revolutionize agriculture and allied fields including aquaculture and fisheries. For these multiple purposes effort, importance of nanotechnology and nanodelivery of drugs, vaccine, nutraceutical, inducing hormones, and growth-promoting anabolics open tremendous opportunity. The paper has been targeted to delineate the possible future application of nanodelivery for the aquaculture development.
