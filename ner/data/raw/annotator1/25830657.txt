Structural Characterization, Technological Functionality, and Physiological Aspects of Fungal β-D-glucans: A Review.
β-D-glucans are a (1→3)-linked glucose polymer with (1→6)-linked side chains and a major component of fungal cell walls. They exhibit structural integrity to the fungal cell wall. In addition, β-glucans are widely used as food adjuvant in food and pharmaceutical industries because of their physico-chemical properties. Several studies have focused on different isolation processes of (1→3) (1→6)-β-glucan that could affect the physico-chemical and functional properties of β-glucan such as chemical composition, solubility, viscosity, hydration properties, and oil binding capacity. Immunological activity is one of the most important properties of β-glucans. Thus, they are effective in inhibiting growth of cancer cells and metastasis and preventing bacterial infection. In humans, β-glucans reduce blood cholesterol, improve glucose absorption by body cells, and so help wound healing. This review described the prebiotic potentiality of fungal β-D-glucans with the objective to detail the methodologies applied for their extraction, their structure and techno-functional properties, and finally their biological effects.
