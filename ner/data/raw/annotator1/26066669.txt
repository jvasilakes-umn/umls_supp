Omega-3 fatty acids - A review of existing and innovative delivery methods.
Omega-3 fatty acids are generally under-consumed in Western diets; a factor that may largely be attributed to low intake of oily fish. Although supplementation strategies offer one approach in terms of improving blood fatty acid levels, rates of compliance are generally low due to difficulties in swallowing capsules, or unfavorable aftertastes. Consequently, new approaches, including food-based strategies, may be an alternative approach to improving omega-3 status and the health of public sectors. This paper sets out to discuss and review how the use of novel food vehicle and delivery advancements may be used to improve omega-3 status, which may have wider benefits for public health and well-being.
