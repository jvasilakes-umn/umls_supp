Bioavailability of enteric-coated microencapsulated calcium during pregnancy: a randomized crossover trial in Bangladesh.
BACKGROUND: Prenatal calcium and iron supplements are recommended in settings of low dietary calcium intake and high prevalence of anemia. However, calcium administration may inhibit iron absorption. To overcome calcium-iron interactions, we developed a multi-micronutrient powder containing iron (60 mg), folic acid (400 Î¼g), and calcium carbonate granules microencapsulated with a pH-sensitive enteric coating to delay intestinal release. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to establish in vivo evidence that enteric-coated (EC) calcium is bioavailable in pregnant women and to explore the dose-responsiveness of fractional calcium absorption (FCA) in pregnancy. DESIGN: This was a randomized crossover trial in pregnant women (26-28 wk of gestation) in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Participants were allocated to 1 of 3 dose groups (500, 1000, or 1500 mg elemental Ca). FCA was estimated in random order for EC and non-EC (control) granules by a dual-stable-isotope method ((44)Ca-labeled granules and intravenous (42)Ca) on the basis of the relative recovery of (44)Ca compared with (42)Ca in urine over 48 h. RESULTS: Forty-nine participants with FCA for both EC and non-EC granules were included in the primary analyses. FCA geometric means were as follows: 21.8% (500 mg), 9.2% (1000 mg), and 11.7% (1500 mg) for non-EC granules compared with 3.3% (500 mg), 1.2% (1000 mg), and 2.1% for EC granules. Cumulative 48-h FCA of EC calcium was 85% lower (P < 0.001) than that of non-EC calcium, after adjustment for dose. In comparison to 500 mg, the FCA for the 1000-mg dose was 61% lower (P < 0.001) and was 42% lower (P = 0.002) for the 1500-mg dose, after adjustment for formulation. CONCLUSIONS: A pH-sensitive enteric coating substantially reduced calcium absorption from a prenatal multi-micronutrient powder. In its current formulation, this novel supplement is not suitable for clinical use. FCA was highly dose-dependent, such that doses of 1000 and 1500 mg delivered only negligibly more bioavailable calcium than the 500-mg dose. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01678079.
