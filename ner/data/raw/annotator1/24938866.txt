Early optimal nutrition improves neurodevelopmental outcomes for very preterm infants.
Recent advances in perinatal and neonatal intensive care have resulted in significant improvements in the survival of preterm extremely low-birthweight (PELBW) infants; however, extrauterine growth restriction (EUGR) and undernutrition occur frequently during hospitalization and are associated with adverse outcomes, including bronchopulmonary dysplasia, sepsis, and neurodevelopmental impairment. Early optimal parenteral nutrition with adequate amino acids and lipids, especially long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, has been shown to decrease the incidence of EUGR, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotizing enterocolitis, sepsis, and retinopathy of prematurity in animal models and clinical trials. In PELBW infants, breast milk and probiotics have been shown to reduce the incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis, and lactoferrin has been demonstrated to prevent late-onset sepsis. Thus, early administration of optimal postnatal parenteral and enteral nutrients can help prevent neurodevelopmental impairment caused by EUGR, necrotizing enterocolitis, sepsis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and retinopathy of prematurity, and recent evidence indicates such treatment is feasible.
