The functions of CoQ in mitochondrial respiration and as an antioxidant are established, although the lipid likely has additional, presently unknown, roles. While the therapeutic utility of CoQ10 supplements is recognized in the rare cases of primary CoQ10 deficiencies, a potential role for CoQ10 supplements in cardiovascular disease, particularly heart failure, has also been studied for over 40 years. This review summarizes our current knowledge in these areas derived from animal studies and human trials. Current evidence for a benefit of CoQ10 supplements in diseases other than primary CoQ10 deficiencies is insufficient.", "25996176": "Probiotics: The scientific evidence in the context of inflammatory bowel disease.\nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD) generally comprises Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), and their main characteristic is the intestinal mucosa inflammation. Although its origin is not yet fully known, there is growing evidence related to genetics, intestinal microbiota composition, and the immune system factors such as precursors for the initiation and progression of intestinal conditions. The use of certain probiotic microorganisms has been touted as a possible and promising therapeutic approach in reducing the risk of inflammatory bowel disease, specifically ulcerative colitis. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the benefits of probiotics, indicating that some bacterial strains are able to positively modulate the intestinal microbiota and the immune system, and to produce metabolites with anti-inflammatory properties. The aim of this paper is to bring together the various results and information, based on scientific evidence, that are related to probiotics and inflammatory bowel disease, emphasizing the possible mechanisms involved in this action.", "24965307": "Effects of homocysteine lowering with B vitamins on cognitive aging: meta-analysis of 11 trials with cognitive data on 22,000 individuals.\nBACKGROUND: Elevated plasma homocysteine is a risk factor for Alzheimer disease, but the relevance of homocysteine lowering to slow the rate of cognitive aging is uncertain. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to assess the effects of treatment with B vitamins compared with placebo, when administered for several years, on composite domains of cognitive function, global cognitive function, and cognitive aging. DESIGN: A meta-analysis was conducted by using data combined from 11 large trials in 22,000 participants. Domain-based z scores (for memory, speed, and executive function and a domain-composite score for global cognitive function) were available before and after treatment (mean duration: 2.3 y) in the 4 cognitive-domain trials (1340 individuals); Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)-type tests were available at the end of treatment (mean duration: 5 y) in the 7 global cognition trials (20,431 individuals). RESULTS: The domain-composite and MMSE-type global cognitive function z scores both decreased with age (mean \u00b1 SE: -0.054 \u00b1 0.004 and -0.036 \u00b1 0.001/y, respectively). Allocation to B vitamins lowered homocysteine concentrations by 28% in the cognitive-domain trials but had no significant effects on the z score differences from baseline for individual domains or for global cognitive function (z score difference: 0.00; 95% CI: -0.05, 0.06). Likewise, allocation to B vitamins lowered homocysteine by 26% in the global cognition trials but also had no significant effect on end-treatment MMSE-type global cognitive function (z score difference: -0.01; 95% CI: -0.03, 0.02). Overall, the effect of a 25% reduction in homocysteine equated to 0.02 y (95% CI: -0.10, 0.13 y) of cognitive aging per year and excluded reductions of >1 mo per year of treatment. CONCLUSION: Homocysteine lowering by using B vitamins had no significant effect on individual cognitive domains or global cognitive function or on cognitive aging.", "26561625": "Psyllium fiber improves glycemic control proportional to loss of glycemic control: a meta-analysis of data in euglycemic subjects, patients at risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus, and patients being treated for type 2 diabetes mellitus.\nBACKGROUND: A number of health benefits are associated with intake of soluble, viscous, gel-forming fibers, including reduced serum cholesterol and the attenuation of postprandial glucose excursions. OBJECTIVE: We assess the effects of psyllium, which is a soluble, gel-forming, nonfermented fiber supplement, on glycemic control in patients who were being treated for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and in patients who were at risk of developing T2DM. DESIGN: A comprehensive search was performed of available published literature (Scopus scientific database) and clinical records stored by Procter & Gamble with the use of key search terms to identify clinical studies that assessed the glycemic effects of psyllium in nondiabetic, pre-T2DM, and T2DM patients. RESULTS: We identified 35 randomized, controlled, clinical studies that spanned 3 decades and 3 continents. These data were assessed in 8 meta-analyses. In patients with T2DM, multiweek studies (psyllium dosed before meals) showed significant improvement in both the fasting blood glucose (FBG) concentration (-37.0 mg/dL; P < 0.001) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) [-0.97% (-10.6 mmol/mol); P = 0.048]. Glycemic effects were proportional to baseline FBG; no significant glucose lowering was observed in euglycemic subjects, a modest improvement was observed in subjects with pre-T2DM, and the greatest improvement was observed in subjects who were being treated for T2DM. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that psyllium would be an effective addition to a lifestyle-intervention program. The degree of psyllium's glycemic benefit was commensurate with the loss of glycemic control. Because the greatest effect was seen in patients who were being treated for T2DM, additional studies are needed to determine how best to incorporate psyllium into existing prevention and treatment algorithms with concomitant hypoglycemic medications.", "26175488": "Potential role of the intestinal microbiota in programming health and disease.\nThe composition of the microbiota varies according to prenatal events, delivery methods, infant feeding, infant care environment, and antibiotic use. Postnatal gut function and immune development are largely influenced by the intestinal microbiota. Emerging evidence has shown that early microbiota colonization may influence the occurrence of later diseases (microbial programming). The vast majority of microbial species (commensals) give rise to symbiotic host-bacterial interactions that are fundamental for human health. However, changes in the composition of the gut microbiota (dysbiosis) may be associated with several clinical conditions, including obesity and metabolic diseases, autoimmune diseases and allergy, acute and chronic intestinal inflammation, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), allergic gastroenteritis (e.g., eosinophilic gastroenteritis and allergic IBS), and necrotizing enterocolitis. Based on recent advances, modulation of gut microbiota with probiotics, prebiotics, or fermented dairy products has been suggested as a treatment of, or prevention for, different disorders such as IBS, infectious diarrhea, allergic disease, and necrotizing enterocolitis.", "26561619": "Folate and long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation during pregnancy has long-term effects on the attention system of 8.5-y-old offspring: a randomized controlled trial.\nBACKGROUND: During fetal and perinatal periods, many nutrients, such as long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids [contained in fish oil (FO)] and folate, are important in achieving normal brain development. Several studies have shown the benefits of early nutrition on children's neurocognitive development. However, the evidence with regard to the attention system is scarce. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to analyze the long-term effects of FO, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF), or FO+5-MTHF prenatal supplementation on attention networks. DESIGN: Participants were 136 children born to mothers from the NUHEAL (Nutraceuticals for a Healthy Life) project (randomly assigned to receive FO and/or 5-MTHF or placebo prenatal supplementation) who were recalled for a new examination 8.5 y later. The response conflict-resolution ability (using congruent and incongruent conditions)), alerting, and spatial orienting of attention were evaluated with behavioral measures (Attention Network Test), electroencephalography/event-related potentials (ERPs), and standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA). RESULTS: Children born to mothers supplemented with 5-MTHF alone solved the response conflict more quickly than did the placebo and the FO+5-MTHF groups (all P < 0.05). Differences between ERP amplitudes for the conflict conditions were also observed. sLORETA analysis showed higher activation of the right midcingulate cortex for the incongruent condition. In addition, a significant slowing down of response speed depending on the warning cue in the 5-MTHF and FO groups was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Folate supplementation during pregnancy, rather than FO or FO+5-MTHF supplementation, improves children's ability to solve response conflicts. This advantage seems to be based on the higher activation of the midcingulate cortex, indicating that early nutrition influences the functionality of specific brain areas involved in executive functions.

However, optimal intake recommendations for protection are unknown. OBJECTIVE: We systematically investigated associations between fish and PUFA intake and mild-to-severe cognitive impairment risk. DESIGN: Studies that reported risk estimates for mild cognitive impairment (MCI), cognitive decline, dementia, Alzheimer disease (AD), or Parkinson disease (PD) from fish, total PUFAs, total n-3 (\u03c9-3) PUFAs, or at least one n-3 PUFA were included. Study characteristics and outcomes were extracted. The pooled RR was estimated with the use of a random-effects model meta-analysis. A dose-response analysis was conducted with the use of the 2-stage generalized least-squares trend program. RESULTS: We included 21 studies (181,580 participants) with 4438 cases identified during follow-up periods (2.1-21 y). A 1-serving/wk increment of dietary fish was associated with lower risks of dementia (RR: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.90, 0.99; P = 0.042, I(2) = 63.4%) and AD (RR: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.90, 0.95; P = 0.003, I(2) = 74.8%). Pooled RRs of MCI and PD were 0.71 (95% CI: 0.59, 0.82; P = 0.733, I(2) = 0%) and 0.90 (95% CI: 0.80, 0.99; P = 0.221, I(2) = 33.7%), respectively, for an 8-g/d increment of PUFA intake. As an important source of marine n-3 PUFAs, a 0.1-g/d increment of dietary docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) intake was associated with lower risks of dementia (RR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.76, 0.96; P < 0.001, I(2) = 92.7%) and AD (RR: 0.63; 95% CI: 0.51, 0.76; P < 0.001, I(2) = 94.5%). Significant curvilinear relations between fish consumption and risk of AD and between total PUFAs and risk of MCI (both P-nonlinearity < 0.001) were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Fishery products are recommended as dietary sources and are associated with lower risk of cognitive impairment. Marine-derived DHA was associated with lower risk of dementia and AD but without a linear dose-response relation.", "24915384": "Flavonoids and immune function in human: a systematic review.\nFlavonoids, through a modulation of immune function, have been suggested to be involved in the role played by plant foods in disease prevention.

A total of 58 studies, were identified as suitable: 41 addressed in vivo proinflammatory cytokines and 15 measured ex vivo markers of immune function. According to our findings and on the basis of single food items, the number of studies in humans is limited and, for galenic supplements, only quercetin has been investigated.

OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to assess dose-dependent effects of dairy fat and metabolic syndrome (MetS) health status on \u03b1-tocopherol pharmacokinetics in plasma and lipoproteins. DESIGN: A randomized, crossover, double-blind study was conducted in healthy and MetS adults (n = 10/group) who ingested encapsulated hexadeuterium-labeled (d6)-RRR-\u03b1-tocopherol (15 mg) with 240 mL nonfat (0.2 g fat), reduced-fat (4.8 g fat), or whole (7.9 g fat) milk before blood collection at regular intervals for 72 h. RESULTS: Compared with healthy participants, those with MetS had lower (P < 0.05) baseline plasma \u03b1-tocopherol (\u03bcmol/mmol lipid) and greater oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, and C-reactive protein. Regardless of health status, d6-\u03b1-tocopherol bioavailability was unaffected by increasing amounts of dairy fat provided by milk beverages, but MetS participants had lower estimated d6-\u03b1-tocopherol absorption (\u00b1SEM) than did healthy participants (26.1% \u00b1 1.0% compared with 29.5% \u00b1 1.1%). They also had lower plasma d6-\u03b1-tocopherol AUC from 0 to 72 h, as well as maximal concentrations (Cmax: 2.04 \u00b1 0.14 compared with 2.73 \u00b1 0.18 \u03bcmol/L) and slower rates of plasma disappearance but similar times to Cmax. MetS participants had lower d6-\u03b1-tocopherol AUC from t = 0-12 h (AUC0- t final) in lipoprotein fractions [chylomicron, very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), LDL, high-density lipoprotein]. Percentages of d6-\u03b1-tocopherol AUC0- t final in both the chylomicron (r = -0.46 to -0.52) and VLDL (r = -0.49 to -0.68) fractions were inversely correlated with oxidized LDL, IL-10, IL-6, and C-reactive protein. CONCLUSIONS: At dietary intakes equivalent to the Recommended Dietary Allowance, \u03b1-tocopherol bioavailability is unaffected by dairy fat quantity but is lower in MetS adults, potentially because of greater inflammation and oxidative stress that limits small intestinal \u03b1-tocopherol absorption and/or impairs hepatic \u03b1-tocopherol trafficking. These findings support higher dietary \u03b1-tocopherol requirements for MetS adults.

Gut-associated lymphoid tissues, the largest mucosal immune system, should never be overlooked for their profound effect in maintaining the host immunity. Therefore, we discussed the relationship between gut immunity and host health, primarily from two aspects: the homeostasis of gut microbiota, and the function of gut-associated lymphoid tissues. Polysaccharides, widely concerned as bioactive macromolecules in recent centuries, have been proved to benefit the intestinal health. Dietary polysaccharides can improve the ratio of probiotics, regulate the intestinal microenvironment like decreasing the gut pH, and stimulate the macrophages or lymphocytes in gut tissues to fight against diseases like cancer.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to investigate the effect of the probiotic strain Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, L. casei 431 (Chr. Hansen A/S) (hereafter, L. casei 431) on immune response to influenza vaccination and respiratory symptoms in healthy adults. DESIGN: A randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in 1104 healthy subjects aged 18-60 y at 2 centers in Germany and Denmark. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive an acidified milk drink containing \u226510(9) colony-forming units of L. casei 431 (n = 553) or placebo (n = 551) for 42 d. After 21 d, subjects received the seasonal influenza vaccination. The primary outcome was seroprotection rate (anti-influenza antibody titers by hemagglutination inhibition) 21 d after vaccination. Other outcomes were seroconversion rate and mean titers, influenza A-specific antibodies and incidence, and duration and severity of upper respiratory symptoms. Antibiotic use and use of health care resources were recorded. RESULTS: There was no effect of L. casei 431 on immune responses to influenza vaccination. Generalized linear mixed modeling showed a shorter duration of upper respiratory symptoms in the probiotic group than in the placebo group (mean \u00b1 SD: 6.4 \u00b1 6.1 vs. 7.3 \u00b1 9.7 d, P = 0.0059) in the last 3 wk of the intervention period. No statistically significant differences were found for incidence or severity. CONCLUSIONS: Daily consumption of L. casei 431 resulted in no observable effect on the components of the immune response to influenza vaccination but reduced the duration of upper respiratory symptoms.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate prenatal n-3 LC-PUFA dietary exposure in observational studies and n-3 LC-PUFA supplementation in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on outcomes of IgE-mediated allergic disease. DESIGN: We conducted searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, SCOPUS, and Web of Science to 30 July 2015. We included prospective cohort studies that showed an association between maternal fish or n-3 LC-PUFA intake during pregnancy and RCTs with a prenatal intervention to modify maternal n-3 LC-PUFA intake and outcomes of allergic disease (eczema, rhino-conjunctivitis, asthma) or sensitization in the offspring. RESULTS: A total of 13 publications from 10 prospective cohort studies and 7 publications representing 5 unique RCTs were included. Three RCTs were combined in a meta-analysis for selected outcomes. Nine of 13 observational study publications and 5 of 7 publications from RCTs found a protective association between increased prenatal n-3 LC-PUFA or fish intake and incidence of allergic disease symptoms in the child. Meta-analysis was limited because of the heterogeneity of the RCTs. Pooled results showed a significant reduction in the incidence of \"atopic eczema,\" \"any positive SPT [skin-prick test],\" \"sensitization to egg,\" and \"sensitization to any food\" in the first 12 mo of life [RRs (95% CIs): 0.53 (0.35, 0.81), P = 0.004; 0.68 (0.52-0.89), P = 0.006; 0.55 (0.39-0.76), P = 0.0004; and 0.59 (0.46, 0.76), P < 0.0001, respectively]. CONCLUSIONS: Our systematic review and meta-analysis was suggestive of benefits of increased n-3 LC-PUFAs in the maternal diet and outcomes of childhood allergic disease.

Despite large increases in consumption, studies documenting the nutritional, metabolic, and health implications of these beverages are limited. This review provides some important methodological considerations in the examination of these drinks and highlights their potential impact on the gastrointestinal system, liver, and metabolic health. The gastrointestinal system is important as it comes into contact with the highest concentration of energy drink ingredients and initiates a chain of events to communicate with peripheral tissues. Although energy drinks have diverse compositions, including taurine, ginseng, and carnitine, the most metabolically deleterious ingredients appear to be simple sugars (such as glucose and fructose) and caffeine. In combination, these last two ingredients have the greatest metabolic impact and potential influence on overall health.", "25293546": "Energy drink and energy shot use in the military.\nUse of energy drinks and energy shots among military personnel is controversial. High amounts of caffeine (the primary active ingredient in these products) may impact performance of military duties. The impact of caffeine overconsumption and potential subsequent side effects that might be experienced by service members with unique roles and responsibilities is a concern. Reported here are the prevalence of use, reasons for use, and side effects associated with consumption of energy drinks and energy shots among several populations of active duty personnel in the US military. A snowball survey was sent to over 10,000 active duty personnel. A total of 586 (\u223c6% response rate) individuals completed a 30-item electronic survey. Over half of respondents (53%) reported consuming an energy drink at least once in the past 30 days. One in five (19%) reported energy shot consumption in the prior 30 days. One in five (19%) also reported consuming an energy drink in combination with an alcoholic beverage. Age and gender were significantly associated with energy drink consumption. Young male respondents (18-29 years) reported the highest use of both energy drinks and energy shots. Among those reporting energy drink and energy shot use, the most common reasons for consumption were to improve mental alertness (61%) and to improve mental (29%) and physical (20%) endurance. Nearly two-thirds (65%) of users self-reported at least one side effect. The most commonly reported side effects included increased pulse rate/palpitations, restlessness, and difficulty sleeping.

Acidic oligosaccharides, such as sialyllactose (SL), contain sialic acid (SA) residues. In human milk, approximately 73% of SA is bound to oligosaccharides, whereas only 3% is present in free form. Oligosaccharides are highly resistant to hydrolysis in the gastrointestinal tract. Only a small portion of the available oligosaccharides in breast milk is absorbed in the neonatal small intestine. SL and sialylated oligosaccharides are thought to have significant health benefits for the neonate, because of their roles in supporting resistance to pathogens, gut maturation, immune function, and cognitive development. The need for SA to allow proper development during the neonatal period is thought to exceed the endogenous synthesis. Therefore, these structures are important nutrients for the neonate. Based on the potential benefits, SL and sialylated oligosaccharides may be interesting components for application in infant nutrition. Once the hurdle of limited availability of these oligosaccharides has been overcome, their functionality can be explored in more detail, and supplementation of infant formula may become feasible.", "26287529": "Probiotic Lactic Acid Bacteria and Skin Health.\nHuman skin is the first defense barrier against the external environment, especially microbial pathogens and physical stimulation. Many studies on skin health with Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) have been published for many years, including prevention of skin disease and improvement of skin conditions. LAB, a major group of gram-positive bacteria, are known to be beneficial to human health by acting as probiotics. Recent studies have shown that LAB and their extracts have beneficial effects on maintenance and improvement of skin health. Oral administration of Lactobacillus delbrueckii inhibits the development of atopic disease. In addition, LAB and LAB extracts are known to have beneficial effects on intestinal diseases, with Lactobacillus plantarum having been shown to attenuate IL-10 deficient colitis. In addition to intestinal health, L. plantarum also has beneficial effects on skin. pLTA, which is lipoteichoic acid isolated from L. plantarum, has anti-photoaging effects on human skin cells by regulating the expression matrix meralloprotionase-1 (MMP-1) expression. While several studies have proposed a relationship between diseases of the skin and small intestines, there are currently no published reviews of the effects of LAB for skin health through regulation of intestinal conditions and the immune system.

OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the effect of prenatal CSB Plus supplementation on birth weight and secondary outcomes of low birth weight (<2500 g), small for gestational age, birth length and head circumference, preterm birth (<37 wk), maternal weight gain, and anemia at 24-28 wk, 30-32 wk, and 36-38 wk of gestation among rural Cambodian women. DESIGN: A cluster-randomized trial was conducted in 75 villages in Kampong Chhnang Province, in which 547 women received CSB Plus (treatment) during the first trimester until delivery or continued their normal diet (control) based on their village residence. All women received routine daily iron folic acid tablets and were treated with additional iron folic acid if they were anemic (hemoglobin <11 g/dL). Cluster-adjusted linear mixed-effect and logistic regression models were used to examine group differences. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in birth weight between the CSB Plus and control group (46 g; 95% CI: -31, 123 g; P = 0.24). Significant reductions were observed in preterm birth (OR = 0.33; 95% CI: 0.12, 0.89) and anemia at 36-38 wk (OR = 0.51; 95% CI: 0.34, 0.77). There were no significant differences in low birth weight, small for gestational age, birth length, head circumference, or maternal weight gain. A higher rate of fetal loss was observed in the treatment group (10.2% compared with 3.7%; P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In Cambodian women, CSB Plus consumed during pregnancy did not significantly increase maternal weight gain or improve birth size but did reduce maternal anemia in late gestation and preterm birth in comparison with women consuming a normal diet. The unexpectedly higher rate of fetal loss in the treatment group is concerning and warrants further investigation.

In nonpregnant populations, the selenium status or response to supplementation has been associated with polymorphisms in dimethylglycine dehydrogenase (DMGDH), selenoprotein P (SEPP1) and the glutathione peroxidases [cytosolic glutathione peroxidase (GPx1) and phospholipid glutathione peroxidase (GPx4)]. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that, in pregnant women, these candidate polymorphisms would be associated with selenium status in early pregnancy, its longitudinal change, and the interindividual response to selenium supplementation at 60 \u03bcg/d. DESIGN: With the use of stored samples and data from the United Kingdom Selenium in Pregnancy Intervention (SPRINT) study in 227 pregnant women, we carried out genetic-association studies, testing for associations between selenium status, its longitudinal change, and response to supplementation and common genetic variation in DMGDH (rs921943), SEPP1 (rs3877899 and rs7579), GPx1 (rs1050450) and GPx4 (rs713041). Selenium status was represented by the concentration of whole-blood selenium at 12 and 35 wk of gestation, the concentration of toenail selenium at 16 wk of gestation, and plasma glutathione peroxidase (GPx3) activity at 12 and 35 wk of gestation. RESULTS: Our results showed that DMGDH rs921943 was significantly associated with the whole-blood selenium concentration at 12 wk of gestation (P = 0.032), which explained \u22642.0% of the variance. This association was replicated with the use of toenail selenium (P = 0.043). In unsupplemented women, SEPP1 rs3877899 was significantly associated with the percentage change in whole-blood selenium from 12 to 35 wk of gestation (P = 0.005), which explained 8% of the variance. In supplemented women, SEPP1 rs3877899 was significantly associated with the percentage change in GPx3 activity from 12 to 35 wk of gestation (P = 0.01), which explained 5.3% of the variance. Selenium status was not associated with GPx1, GPx4, or SEPP1 rs7579. CONCLUSIONS: In agreement with previous studies, we show that the genetic variant rs921943 in DMGDH is significantly associated with selenium status in United Kingdom pregnant women. Notably, our study shows that women who carry the SEPP1 rs3877899 A allele are better able to maintain selenium status during pregnancy, and their GPx3 activity increases more with supplementation, which suggests better protection from low selenium status.

This article presents the information regarding some biologically active constituents occurring in commonly used herbs, viz., alkaloids, anthraquinones, bitters, flavonoids, saponins, tannins, and essential oils, their physiological functionalities, and also the description of few herbs of importance, viz., Asparagus racemosus, Withania somnifera, Bacopa monniera, Pueraria tuberose, Emblica officinalis, Terminalia chebula, Terminalia belerica, Terminalia arjuna, and Aloe vera, in terms of their chemical composition, biological functionality, and toxicity. This article also reviews the use of herbs and their active ingredients in foods and their interactions with different food constituents.", "24915385": "Comparison of molecular techniques with other methods for identification and enumeration of probiotics in fermented milk products.\nNowadays, an increasing attention is being given to fermented milk products including yogurt, kefir, buttermilk, and acidophilus milk. Fermented milks, especially the ones containing probiotics, are claimed to be useful for health of host (such as intestinal- and immune-associated diseases). Their healthful effects could be significantly enhanced by incorporating probiotic microorganisms; those have healthful advantages for host when consumed in an appropriate viable number in food products. Probiotic dairy products have stepped to the market and are being commercially produced under various brand names. In addition, these products are legislatively obliged to be labeled for the microorganisms contained. Therefore, identification and enumeration of their microorganisms are a cause of concern. Several culture-dependent methods have been introduced and used to identify the microorganisms, in which the researchers have experienced multiple difficulties. Thereby, molecular approaches were present as an alternative, offering advantages such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and speed. This article reviews the molecular approaches employed for identification and enumeration of probiotics in fermented milk products.", "25675369": "Exopolysaccharides Produced by Lactic Acid Bacteria and Bifidobacteria as Fermentable Substrates by the Intestinal Microbiota.\nThe functional food market, including products formulated to maintain a \"healthy\" gut microbiota, i.e. probiotics and prebiotics, has increased enormously since the end of the last century. In order to favor the competitiveness of this sector, as well as to increase our knowledge of the mechanisms of action upon human health, new probiotic strains and prebiotic substrates are being studied. This review discusses the use of exopolysaccharides (EPS), both homopolysaccharides (HoPS) and heteropolysaccharides (HePS), synthesized by lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria as potential prebiotics. These extracellular carbohydrate polymers synthesized by some gut inhabitants seem to be resistant to gastrointestinal digestion; these are susceptible as well to biodegradability by the intestinal microbiota depending on both the physicochemical characteristics of EPS and the pool of glycolytic enzymes harbored by microbiota. Therefore, although the chemical composition of these HoPS and HePS is different, both can be fermentable substrates by intestinal inhabitants and good candidates as prebiotic substrates. However, there are limitations for their use as additives in the food industry due to, on the one hand, their low production yield and, on the other hand, a lack of clinical studies demonstrating the functionality of these biopolymers.", "26561623": "Specialized proresolving lipid mediators in humans with the metabolic syndrome after n-3 fatty acids and aspirin.\nBACKGROUND: The metabolic syndrome (MetS) is associated with a chronic low-grade inflammatory state and may be affected by the ability to resolve inflammation, which is an active process that involves specialized proresolving lipid mediators (SPMs) derived from n-3 (\u03c9-3) fatty acids. OBJECTIVE: We compared plasma concentrations of SPMs in men and women with features of the MetS and in healthy matched control subjects in response to intakes of n-3 fatty acids and aspirin. DESIGN: MetS volunteers (n = 22) and healthy, matched controls (n = 21) were studied in parallel for 4 wk. Both groups took n-3 fatty acids (2.4 g/d) for 4 wk with the addition of aspirin (300 mg/d) during the last 7 d. Blood was collected at baseline and at 3 and 4 wk. Plasma SPMs were measured with the use of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and included 18-hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acid (18-HEPE), E-series resolvins, 17-hydroxydocosahexaenoic acid (17-HDHA), D-series resolvins, 14-hydroxydocosahexaenoic acid (14-HDHA), and maresin-1. RESULTS: Baseline SPMs did not differ between groups. There was an increase in the SPM precursors 18-HEPE, 17-HDHA, and 14-HDHA after n-3 fatty acid supplementation that was significantly attenuated in the MetS (P < 0.05). However, the E-series resolvins increased to a similar extent in the groups after n-3 fatty acid supplementation, and the D-series resolvins were not different from those at baseline. The addition of aspirin to n-3 fatty acids did not alter any SPMs in either group. CONCLUSIONS: Volunteers with MetS had reduced plasma concentrations of the precursors of the E- and D- series resolvins as well as of 14-HDHA in response to n-3 fatty acid supplementation. However, plasma E-series resolvins were increased to a similar extent after n-3 fatty acid supplementation in both groups, and the addition of aspirin to n-3 fatty acid supplementation did not alter any of the plasma SPMs in MetS and control subjects. Additional studies in the MetS are required to determine whether SPMs affect the ability to mount an appropriate response to infection. This trial was registered at the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry as ACTRN12610000708055.", "26561624": "Prebiotic consumption and the incidence of overweight in a Mediterranean cohort: the Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra Project.\nBACKGROUND: The consumption of prebiotics (fermentable and nondigestible carbohydrates) has been proposed as a potentially protective factor against overweight and obesity. However, to our knowledge, no previous prospective studies have assessed the association between the consumption of prebiotics and the incidence of overweight or obesity. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the association between prebiotic consumption [fructans and galacto-oligosaccharides (GOSs)] and the incidence of overweight [body mass index (BMI; in kg/m(2)) \u226525] in the SUN (Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra) Project, which is a prospective cohort of Spanish, middle-aged university graduates with initial BMI <25. DESIGN: The SUN Project is a dynamic, prospective, multipurpose cohort of Spanish university graduates with an overall retention rate of 90%. The study population encompassed 8569 Spanish university graduates (mean age: 37 y) who were initially free of overweight or obesity. Self-reported weight (previously validated) was collected at baseline and updated every 2 y during the follow-up period. Fructan consumption and GOS consumption were assessed with the use of a validated semiquantitative 136-item food-frequency questionnaire and were updated after 10 y. Time-dependent Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate HRs and 95% CIs for incident overweight and to adjust for potential confounding factors. RESULTS: During follow-up (median: 9 y), 1964 incident cases of overweight were identified. After potential confounders were adjusted for, risk of overweight was 15% lower in participants in the highest quartile of fructan consumption (\u22652.3 g/d) (95% CI: 0.74, 0.97; P-trend = 0.019). Subjects in the highest quartile of GOS consumption (\u22650.45 g/d) had 17% lower risk of overweight (95% CI: 0.74, 0.94; P-trend = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Higher prebiotic consumption was associated with lower risk of overweight in a cohort of initially normal-weight, middle-aged adults. This potential protection has been previously scarcely assessed; therefore, additional longitudinal studies are needed to confirm our results.", "26156733": "Insulin secretion and sensitivity in healthy adults with low vitamin D are not affected by high-dose ergocalciferol administration: a randomized controlled trial.\nBACKGROUND: Epidemiologic data suggest that low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] increases insulin resistance and the risk of type 2 diabetes. Few interventional trials have assessed the effect of vitamin D on insulin metabolism, and published results are discordant. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to perform a detailed assessment of the effect of ergocalciferol administration on glucose and insulin metabolism in healthy people with low total 25(OH)D(total). DESIGN: This was a 12-wk, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial. We enrolled 90 healthy volunteers aged 18-45 y with serum 25(OH)D \u226420 ng/mL (by immunoassay) and administered 50,000 IU ergocalciferol/wk or placebo for 12 wk. Primary endpoints were change in first-phase insulin response and insulin sensitivity as measured by intravenous glucose tolerance test. Secondary endpoints included change in homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance; fasting glucose, insulin, and lipids; body mass index (BMI); and blood pressure. RESULTS: On-study 25(OH)D(total) was assessed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. In the treated group, 25(OH)D(total) rose from 18 \u00b1 7 to 43 \u00b1 12 ng/mL (P < 0.001) with no change in the placebo group. Despite this increase, at 12 wk, there were no between-group differences in either insulin response or insulin sensitivity; nor were there differences in any measured secondary endpoints. There was no evidence of effect modification by sex, race, glucose tolerance status, baseline 25(OH)D(total), or BMI. CONCLUSION: In healthy persons with low 25(OH)D(total), ergocalciferol administration for 12 wk normalizes 25(OH)D(total) but does not improve insulin secretion, insulin sensitivity, or other markers of metabolic health.", "26156734": "Vitamin and carotenoid intake and risk of head-neck cancer subtypes in the Netherlands Cohort Study.\nBACKGROUND: Head and neck cancer (HNC) is the seventh most-common type of cancer worldwide. Evidence regarding the potential protective effect of vitamins and carotenoids on HNC is limited and mostly based on case-control studies. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the association of intake of dietary vitamins C and E (including supplementation) and the most-common carotenoids (\u03b1-carotene, \u03b2-carotene, lutein plus zeaxanthin, lycopene, and \u03b2-cryptoxanthin) and risk of HNC and HNC subtypes in a large prospective study. DESIGN: The Netherlands Cohort Study included 120,852 participants. For efficiency reasons, a case-cohort design was used. At baseline in 1986, participants completed a food-frequency questionnaire. A subcohort was randomly selected from the total cohort. After 20.3 y of follow-up, 3898 subcohort members and 415 HNC cases [131 oral cavity cancer (OCCs), 88 oro-/hypopharyngeal cancer (OHPs), and 193 laryngeal cancer cases] were available for analysis. Rate ratios and 95% CIs for highest (quartile 4) compared with lowest (quartile 1) quartiles of vitamin and carotenoid intake were estimated by using the Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: A strong inverse association was shown between vitamin C and HNC overall (multivariable-adjusted rate ratio for quartile 4 compared with quartile 1: 0.39; 95% CI: 0.23, 0.66; P-trend < 0.001), OCC (multivariable-adjusted rate ratio for quartile 4 compared with quartile 1: 0.35; 95% CI: 0.16, 0.77; P-trend < 0.05), and OHPC (multivariable-adjusted rate ratio for quartile 4 compared with quartile 1: 0.29; 95% CI: 0.12, 0.67; P-trend < 0.01). No statistically significant results were shown for vitamin E, \u03b1-carotene, \u03b2-carotene, lycopene, and lutein plus zeaxanthin. The association of vitamin E and HNC was modified by alcohol status (P-interaction = 0.003) with lower risks in alcohol abstainers. CONCLUSIONS: With this study, we show an inverse association between intake of vitamin C and the incidence of HNC and HNC-subtypes. Future research is recommended to investigate the underlying mechanisms and to confirm our results, which may be promising for the prevention of HNC.", "25974694": "Regulation of Selenium Metabolism and Transport.\nSelenium is regulated in the body to maintain vital selenoproteins and to avoid toxicity. When selenium is limiting, cells utilize it to synthesize the selenoproteins most important to them, creating a selenoprotein hierarchy in the cell. The liver is the central organ for selenium regulation and produces excretory selenium forms to regulate whole-body selenium. It responds to selenium deficiency by curtailing excretion and secreting selenoprotein P (Sepp1) into the plasma at the expense of its intracellular selenoproteins. Plasma Sepp1 is distributed to tissues in relation to their expression of the Sepp1 receptor apolipoprotein E receptor-2, creating a tissue selenium hierarchy. N-terminal Sepp1 forms are taken up in the renal proximal tubule by another receptor, megalin. Thus, the regulated whole-body pool of selenium is shifted to needy cells and then to vital selenoproteins in them to supply selenium where it is needed, creating a whole-body selenoprotein hierarchy.", "25057155": "Circulating non-transferrin-bound iron after oral administration of supplemental and fortification doses of iron to healthy women: a randomized study.\nBACKGROUND: After the oral administration of iron, the production of circulating non-transferrin-bound iron may contribute to an increased risk of illness in malaria-endemic areas that lack effective medical services. OBJECTIVE: In healthy women with a range of body iron stores, we aimed to determine effects on the production of circulating non-transferrin-bound iron resulting from the oral administration of 1) a supplemental dose of iron (60 mg) with water, 2) a supplemental dose of iron (60 mg) with a standard test meal, and 3) a fortification dose of iron (6 mg) with a standard test meal. DESIGN: With the use of serum ferritin as the indicator, healthy women with replete iron stores (ferritin concentration >25 \u03bcg/L; n = 16) and reduced iron stores (ferritin concentration \u226425 \u03bcg/L; n = 16) were enrolled in a prospective, randomized, crossover study. After the oral administration of aqueous solutions of ferrous sulfate isotopically labeled with \u2075\u2074Fe, \u2075\u2077Fe, or \u2075\u2078Fe, blood samples were collected for 8 h, and iron absorption was estimated by erythrocyte incorporation at 14 d. RESULTS: At 4 h, serum non-transferrin-bound iron reached peaks with geometric mean (95% CI) concentrations of 0.81 \u03bcmol/L (0.56, 1.1 \u03bcmol/L) for 60 mg Fe with water and 0.26 \u03bcmol/L (0.15, 0.38 \u03bcmol/L) for 60 mg Fe with food but was at assay limits of detection (0.1 \u03bcmol Fe/L) for 6 mg Fe with food. For the 60 mg Fe without food, the area under the curve over 8 h for serum non-transferrin-bound iron was positively correlated with the amount of iron absorbed (R = 0.49, P < 0.01) and negatively correlated with serum ferritin (R = -0.39, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In healthy women, the production of circulating non-transferrin-bound iron is determined by the rate and amount of iron absorbed. The highest concentrations of non-transferrin-bound iron resulted from the administration of supplemental doses of iron without food. Little or no circulating non-transferrin-bound iron resulted from the consumption of a meal with a fortification dose of iron.", "25974693": "New Insights into the Regulation of Chylomicron Production.\nDietary lipids are efficiently absorbed by the small intestine, incorporated into triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (chylomicrons), and transported in the circulation to various tissues. Intestinal lipid absorption and mobilization and chylomicron synthesis and secretion are highly regulated processes. Elevated chylomicron production rate contributes to the dyslipidemia seen in common metabolic disorders such as insulin-resistant states and type 2 diabetes and likely increases the risk for atherosclerosis seen in these conditions. An in-depth understanding of the regulation of chylomicron production may provide leads for the development of drugs that could be of therapeutic utility in the prevention of dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis. Chylomicron secretion is subject to regulation by various factors, including diet, body weight, genetic variants, hormones, nutraceuticals, medications, and emerging interventions such as bariatric surgical procedures. In this review we discuss the regulation of chylomicron production, mechanisms that underlie chylomicron dysregulation, and potential avenues for future research.", "25971716": "Circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D and survival in women with ovarian cancer.\nBACKGROUND: Vitamin D status might be associated with cancer survival. Survival after ovarian cancer is poor, but the association with vitamin D has rarely been examined. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], a marker of vitamin D status, and ovarian cancer survival. DESIGN: Participants were women with invasive ovarian cancer diagnosed between 2002 and 2005 who participated in the Australian Ovarian Cancer Study. Serum samples, collected at diagnosis (n = 670) or after completion of primary treatment and before recurrence (n = 336), were assayed for 25(OH)D. Sociodemographic, dietary, and lifestyle data came from questionnaires self-completed at recruitment, and clinical and survival data were from medical records, supplemented by linkage to the Australian National Death Index (October 2011). Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate HRs and 95% CIs for the association between circulating 25(OH)D and survival. RESULTS: Overall, 59% of the women died during follow-up, with 95% of deaths resulting from ovarian cancer. Circulating 25(OH)D concentrations (mean: 44 nmol/L) were significantly associated with age, state of residence, season of blood collection, and body mass index but not with tumor histology, stage or grade, or comorbidities. Higher 25(OH)D concentrations at diagnosis were significantly associated with longer survival (adjusted HR: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.88, 0.99 per 10 nmol/L), but there was no significant association with progression-free survival or for 25(OH)D measured after primary treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort, higher serum 25(OH)D concentrations at diagnosis were associated with longer survival among women with ovarian cancer. If confirmed in other studies, this suggests that vitamin D status at diagnosis may be an independent predictor of prognosis. Furthermore, if the association is found to be causal, improving vitamin D status may improve ovarian cancer survival rates.", "26561626": "Guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of iron deficiency across indications: a systematic review.\nBACKGROUND: Guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of iron deficiency (ID) vary widely across indications. OBJECTIVE: We reviewed all available guidelines on the management of ID worldwide. DESIGN: A literature search was conducted in PubMed, Cochrane, and EMBASE and in main professional association websites, limited to documents published between 1 January 2004 and 30 June 2014. RESULTS: Of 127 guidelines identified, 29 were selected, involving 29 professional associations and issued from the United States (n = 8), Europe (n = 6), Britain (n = 4), Canada (n = 3), international organizations (n = 2), France (n = 2), Poland (n = 1), Australia (n = 1), Mexico (n = 1), and Japan (n = 1). A total of 22 and 27 guidelines provided recommendations on diagnosis and treatment of ID, respectively. To define ID, all guidelines recommended a concentration for serum ferritin. One-half of them (10 of 22) proposed transferrin saturation (TSAT) as an alternative or complementary diagnostic test. To treat ID, most of the guidelines (18 of 27) recommended preferentially the oral route if possible, particularly in children and in women in the pre- or postpregnancy period. Iron supplementation should be administered intravenously according to 13 of 27 guidelines, particularly in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) (n = 7) and chemotherapy-induced anemia (n = 5). Treatment targets for ID included an increase in hemoglobin concentrations to 10-12 g/dL or normalization (n = 8) and serum ferritin >100 \u03bcg/L (n = 7) or 200 \u03bcg/L (n = 4). For the latter, in some situations, such as CKD, ferritin concentrations should not exceed 500 \u03bcg/L (n = 5) or 800 \u03bcg/L (n = 5). Only 9 guidelines recommended TSAT as a target, proposing various thresholds ranging from 20% to 50%. CONCLUSIONS: It appears that for the diagnosis of ID, a cutoff of 100 \u03bcg/L for serum ferritin concentration should be considered in most conditions and 20% for TSAT, except in particular situations, including young healthy women with heavy menstrual flow. New indications of intravenous iron supplementation are emerging.", "24829492": "Kinetics of 13C-DHA before and during fish-oil supplementation in healthy older individuals.\nBACKGROUND: Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) kinetics appear to change with intake, which is an effect that we studied in an older population by using uniformly carbon-13-labeled DHA ((13)C-DHA). OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the influence of a fish-oil supplement over 5 mo on the kinetics of (13)C-DHA in older persons. DESIGN: Thirty-four healthy, cognitively normal participants (12 men, 22 women) aged between 52 and 90 y were recruited. Two identical kinetic studies were performed, each with the use of a single oral dose of 40 mg (13)C-DHA. The first kinetic study was performed before participants started taking a 5-mo supplementation that provided 1.4 g DHA/d plus 1.8 g eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)/d (baseline); the second study was performed during the final month of supplementation (supplement). In both kinetic studies, blood and breath samples were collected \u22648 h and weekly over 4 wk to analyze (13)C enrichment. RESULTS: The time \u00d7 supplement interaction for (13)C-DHA in the plasma was not significant, but there were separate time and supplement effects (P < 0.0001). The area under the curve for plasma (13)C-DHA was 60% lower while subjects were taking the supplement than at baseline (P < 0.0001). The uniformly carbon-13-labeled EPA concentration was 2.6 times as high 1 d posttracer while patients were taking the supplement as it was at baseline. The mean (\u00b1SEM) plasma (13)C-DHA half-life was 4.5 \u00b1 0.4 d at baseline compared with 3.0 \u00b1 0.2 d while taking the supplement (P < 0.0001). Compared with baseline, the mean whole-body half-life was 61% lower while subjects were taking the supplement. The loss of (13)C-DHA through \u03b2-oxidation to carbon dioxide labeled with carbon-13 increased from 0.085% of dose/h at baseline to 0.208% of dose/h while subjects were taking the supplement. CONCLUSIONS: In older persons, a supplement of 3.2 g EPA + DHA/d increased \u03b2-oxidation of (13)C-DHA and shortened the plasma (13)C-DHA half-life. Therefore, when circulating concentrations of EPA and DHA are increased, more DHA is available for \u03b2-oxidation. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01577004.", "26115419": "The nutritional role of free sialic acid, a human milk monosaccharide, and its application as a functional food ingredient.\nN-Acetyl-d-neuraminic acid (NANA), more commonly known by its trivial name sialic acid, is an endogenous human and ubiquitous nutritional monosaccharide. As a bound sugar at the terminal positions of glycans NANA is known to play important roles in many biological events. The data that exist on the occurrence of the free monosaccharide in breast milk and nutrition, however, are less commonly discussed. In most foods of animal origin, sialic acid occurs as a mixture of NANA and N-glycolyl-d-neuraminic acid (NGNA), a hydroxylated derivative of NANA that is not found in humans. The dietary intake of NGNA has been identified as a risk factor for long-term adverse health effects. Therefore, we present summaries on the biochemistry, metabolism, bioavailability, and the data on NANA and NGNA levels that occur in diverse foods. Finally, we discuss the emerging data demonstrating that free NANA is linked to positive nutritional effects including pronounced antioxidative properties. These data and the extremely high safety profile of NANA justify dietary enrichment at levels that correspond to the dietary intake of NANA in infants through breast milk.", "25411286": "Benefits of probiotics on enteral nutrition in preterm neonates: a systematic review.\nINTRODUCTION: The optimization of enteral nutrition is a priority in preterm neonates worldwide. Probiotics are known to improve gut maturity and function in preterm neonates. To our knowledge, previous systematic reviews have not adequately assessed the effects of probiotic supplementation on enteral nutrition in preterm neonates. OBJECTIVE: We assessed the evidence on effects of probiotics on enteral nutrition in preterm neonates. DESIGN: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of probiotic supplementation in preterm (gestation <37 wk) or low-birth-weight (birth weight <2500 g) neonates was conducted. With the use of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group strategy, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, EMBASE, and Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature databases and proceedings of Pediatric Academic Society meetings in April 2014. RESULTS: A total of 25 RCTs (n = 5895) were included in the review. A meta-analysis (random-effects model) of data from 19 of 25 trials (n = 4527) estimated that the time to full enteral feeds was shorter in the probiotic group (mean difference: -1.54 d; 95% CI: -2.75, -0.32 d; P < 0.00001, I(2) = 93%). Other benefits included fewer episodes of feed intolerance, better weight gain and growth velocity, decreased transition time from orogastric to breast feeds, and increased postprandial mesenteric flow. There were no adverse effects of probiotic supplementation. CONCLUSIONS: Probiotics reduced the time to full enteral feeds in preterm neonates. Additional research is necessary to assess the optimal dose, duration, and probiotic strain or strains used specifically for facilitating enteral nutrition in this population.", "26114303": "Therapeutic and nutraceutical potential of rosmarinic acid-Cytoprotective properties and pharmacokinetic profile.\nRosmarinic acid (RA) is a natural polyphenolic antioxidant derived from many common herbal plants. This compound displays several important biological properties, including anti-inflammatory, antiviral, antibacterial, antidepressant, anticarcionogenic, and chemopreventive properties. The importance of its activities and its possible application in processed foods as a natural antioxidant has reached a new interest levels in recent years. The health effects of this polyphenol depend greatly on both its intakes and bioavailability. This review focuses on the importance of RA as a dietary supplement, and summarizes its pharmacokinetics and metabolism, including the factors that limit its oral bioavailability which leads to a lower therapeutic action. Further experimental investigations are needed to optimize and enhance the oral bioavailability of this natural compound which consequently will help increasing therapeutic efficacy of RA in vivo.", "26537937": "Safety and efficacy of cocoa flavanol intake in healthy adults: a randomized, controlled, double-masked trial.\nBACKGROUND: Evidence from dietary intervention studies shows that the intake of flavanols and procyanidins can be beneficial for cardiovascular health. Nevertheless, there is a clear need for advancing our understanding with regard to safe amounts of intake for these bioactives. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to investigate in healthy adults the effects of cocoa flavanol (CF) intake amount and intake duration on blood pressure, platelet function, metabolic variables, and potential adverse events (AEs). DESIGN: This investigation consisted of 2 parts. Part 1 was an open-label, intake-amount escalation study, in which 34 healthy adults (aged 35-55 y) consumed escalating amounts of CFs, ranging from 1000 to 2000 mg/d over 6 wk. Primary outcomes were blood pressure and platelet function, select metabolic variables, and the occurrence and severity of AEs. Secondary outcomes included plasma concentrations of CF-derived metabolites and methylxanthines. On the basis of the outcomes of study part 1, and assessing the same outcome measures, part 2 of this investigation was a controlled, randomized, double-masked, 2-parallel-arm dietary intervention study in which healthy participants (aged 35-55 y) were asked to consume for 12 consecutive weeks up to 2000 mg CFs/d (n = 46) or a CF-free control (n = 28). RESULTS: Daily intake of up to 2000 mg CFs/d for 12 wk was not associated with significant changes in blood pressure or platelet function compared with CF-free controls in normotensive, healthy individuals who exhibited a very low risk of cardiovascular disease. There were no clinically relevant changes in the metabolic variables assessed in either of the groups. AEs reported were classified as mild in severity and did not significantly differ between study arms. CONCLUSION: The consumption of CFs in amounts up to 2000 mg/d for 12 wk was well tolerated in healthy men and women. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02447770 (part 1) and NCT02447783 (part 2).", "26739034": "Changes in plasma phosphate during in-patient treatment of children with severe acute malnutrition: an observational study in Uganda.\nBACKGROUND: Children treated for severe acute malnutrition (SAM) are at risk of refeeding hypophosphatemia. Therapeutic diets have only recently become fortified with phosphorus to meet United Nations (UN) specifications, but to our knowledge no studies have investigated the effect. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to assess concentrations and correlates of plasma phosphate (P-phosphate) at admission and during treatment and to identify correlates of changes in P-phosphate. DESIGN: This was a prospective observational study in 6- to 59-mo-old children admitted for treatment of SAM to Mulago Hospital, Uganda. P-phosphate was measured at admission, on the second day of treatment with a therapeutic formula containing 75 kcal/100 mL and 560 mg phosphorus/L (F-75, Nutriset), at the start of the transition to a therapeutic formula containing 100 kcal/100 mL and 579 mg phosphorus/L (F-100; Nutriset), at day 2 of transition, and at discharge. RESULTS: Among 120 children, mean \u00b1 SD P-phosphate at admission was 1.04 \u00b1 0.31 mmol/L and increased by 0.43 (95% CI: 0.35, 0.52) mmol/L during the first 2 d and more slowly toward discharge. Most (79%) children experienced their lowest P-phosphate concentration at admission, and none developed severe hypophosphatemia. P-phosphate was lowest in children with edema and with elevated C-reactive protein, and a lower increase was seen with increasing caretaker-reported severity of illness. Partially or fully replacing F-75 with rice porridge (i.e., a local practice to reduce diarrhea) during the first 2 d of stabilization was associated with a 0.34-mmol/L (95% CI: 0.18, 0.50 mmol/L) lower increase in P-phosphate during the same first 2 d. CONCLUSIONS: F-75, which complies with UN specifications and provides 73 mg phosphorus \u00b7 kg(-1) \u00b7 d(-1) (130 mL \u00b7 kg(-1) \u00b7 d(-1)), seems to prevent refeeding hypophosphatemia in children with SAM. Replacing this formula with rice porridge during the first days of treatment to manage diarrhea may have an adverse effect on P-phosphate concentrations.

The development of suboptimal lean body mass (LBM) could partly explain the link between these two forms of malnutrition. This review examines the evidence on both the role of nutrition in \u201cdevelopmental programming\u201d of LBM and the nutritional influences that affect LBM throughout the life course. Studies from developing countries assessing the relationship of early nutrition with later LBM provide important insights. Overall, the evidence is consistent in suggesting a positive association of early nutritional status (indicated by birth weight and growth during first 2 years) with LBM in later life. Evidence on the impact of maternal nutritional supplementation during pregnancy on later LBM is inconsistent. In addition, the role of nutrients (protein, zinc, calcium, vitamin D) that can affect LBM throughout the life course is described. Promoting optimal intakes of these important nutrients throughout the life course is important for reducing childhood undernutrition as well as for improving the LBM of adults.", "25411294": "Bioavailability of enteric-coated microencapsulated calcium during pregnancy: a randomized crossover trial in Bangladesh.\nBACKGROUND: Prenatal calcium and iron supplements are recommended in settings of low dietary calcium intake and high prevalence of anemia. However, calcium administration may inhibit iron absorption. To overcome calcium-iron interactions, we developed a multi-micronutrient powder containing iron (60 mg), folic acid (400 \u03bcg), and calcium carbonate granules microencapsulated with a pH-sensitive enteric coating to delay intestinal release. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to establish in vivo evidence that enteric-coated (EC) calcium is bioavailable in pregnant women and to explore the dose-responsiveness of fractional calcium absorption (FCA) in pregnancy. DESIGN: This was a randomized crossover trial in pregnant women (26-28 wk of gestation) in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Participants were allocated to 1 of 3 dose groups (500, 1000, or 1500 mg elemental Ca). FCA was estimated in random order for EC and non-EC (control) granules by a dual-stable-isotope method ((44)Ca-labeled granules and intravenous (42)Ca) on the basis of the relative recovery of (44)Ca compared with (42)Ca in urine over 48 h. RESULTS: Forty-nine participants with FCA for both EC and non-EC granules were included in the primary analyses. FCA geometric means were as follows: 21.8% (500 mg), 9.2% (1000 mg), and 11.7% (1500 mg) for non-EC granules compared with 3.3% (500 mg), 1.2% (1000 mg), and 2.1% for EC granules. Cumulative 48-h FCA of EC calcium was 85% lower (P < 0.001) than that of non-EC calcium, after adjustment for dose. In comparison to 500 mg, the FCA for the 1000-mg dose was 61% lower (P < 0.001) and was 42% lower (P = 0.002) for the 1500-mg dose, after adjustment for formulation. CONCLUSIONS: A pH-sensitive enteric coating substantially reduced calcium absorption from a prenatal multi-micronutrient powder. In its current formulation, this novel supplement is not suitable for clinical use. FCA was highly dose-dependent, such that doses of 1000 and 1500 mg delivered only negligibly more bioavailable calcium than the 500-mg dose.

Lowering homocysteine with combined vitamin B-12 and folic acid supplementation may reduce fracture risk. OBJECTIVE: This study [B-vitamins for the PRevention Of Osteoporotic Fractures (B-PROOF)] aimed to determine whether vitamin B-12 and folic acid supplementation reduces osteoporotic fracture incidence in hyperhomocysteinemic elderly individuals. DESIGN: This was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in 2919 participants aged \u226565 y with elevated homocysteine concentrations (12-50 \u03bcmol/L). Participants were assigned to receive daily 500 \u03bcg vitamin B-12 plus 400 \u03bcg folic acid or placebo supplementation for 2 y. Both intervention and placebo tablets also contained 600 IU vitamin D3. The primary endpoint was time to first osteoporotic fracture. Exploratory prespecified subgroup analyses were performed in men and women and in individuals younger than and older than age 80 y. Data were analyzed according to intention-to-treat and per-protocol principles. RESULTS: Osteoporotic fractures occurred in 61 persons (4.2%) in the intervention group and 75 persons (5.1%) in the placebo group. Osteoporotic fracture risk was not significantly different between groups in the intention-to-treat analyses (HR: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.58, 1.21) or per-protocol analyses (HR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.54, 1.21). For persons aged >80 y, in per-protocol analyses, osteoporotic fracture risk was lower in the intervention group than in the placebo group (HR: 0.27; 95% CI: 0.10, 0.74). The total number of adverse events (including mortality) did not differ between groups. However, 63 and 42 participants in the intervention and placebo groups, respectively, reported incident cancer (HR: 1.56; 95% CI: 1.04, 2.31). CONCLUSIONS: These data show that combined vitamin B-12 and folic acid supplementation had no effect on osteoporotic fracture incidence in this elderly population. Exploratory subgroup analyses suggest a beneficial effect on osteoporotic fracture prevention in compliant persons aged >80 y. However, treatment was also associated with increased incidence of cancer, although the study was not designed for assessing cancer outcomes. Therefore, vitamin B-12 plus folic acid supplementation cannot be recommended at present for fracture prevention in elderly people.

Advertising for these products typically features images conjuring great muscle power and endurance; however, the scientific literature provides sparse evidence for an ergogenic role of energy drinks. Although the composition of energy drinks varies, most contain caffeine; carbohydrates, amino acids, herbs, and vitamins are other typical ingredients. This report analyzes the effects of energy drink ingredients on prolonged submaximal (endurance) exercise as well as on short-term strength and power (neuromuscular performance). It also analyzes the effects of energy drink ingredients on the fluid and electrolyte deficit during prolonged exercise. In several studies, energy drinks have been found to improve endurance performance, although the effects could be attributable to the caffeine and/or carbohydrate content. In contrast, fewer studies find an ergogenic effect of energy drinks on muscle strength and power. The existing data suggest that the caffeine dose given in studies of energy drinks is insufficient to enhance neuromuscular performance. Finally, it is unclear if energy drinks are the optimal vehicle to deliver caffeine when high doses are needed to improve neuromuscular performance.", "26499995": "Gut microbiota and probiotics: Focus on diabetes mellitus.\nThe characterization of gut microbiota has become an important area of research in several clinical conditions, including type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Changes in the composition and/or metabolic activity of the gut microbiota can contribute to human health. Thus, this review discusses the effects of probiotics and gut microbiota on metabolic control in these individuals. Relevant studies were obtained from electronic databases such as PubMed/Medline and ISI Web of Science. The main probiotics used in these studies belonged to the genera Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. The authors found seven randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials and 13 experimental studies directly related to the effect of probiotics on metabolic control in the context of T2DM. The hypothesis that gut microbiota plays a role in the development of diabetes indicates an important beginning, and the potential of probiotics to prevent and reduce the severity of T2DM is better observed in animal studies. In clinical trials, the use of probiotics in glycemic control presented conflicting results, and only few studies have attempted to evaluate factors that justify metabolic changes, such as markers of oxidative stress, inflammation, and incretins. Thus, further research is needed to assess the effects of probiotics in the metabolism of diabetic individuals, as well as the main mechanisms involved in this complex relationship.", "25240082": "Zinc deficiency in children with environmental enteropathy-development of new strategies: report from an expert workshop.\nZinc deficiency is a major cause of childhood morbidity and mortality. The WHO/UNICEF strategy for zinc supplementation as adjunctive therapy for diarrhea is poorly implemented. A conference of experts in zinc nutrition and gastrointestinal disorders was convened to consider approaches that might complement the current recommendation and what research was needed to develop these approaches. Several key points were identified. The design of novel zinc interventions would be facilitated by a better understanding of how disturbed gut function, such as environmental (or tropical) enteropathy, affects zinc absorption, losses, and homeostasis. Because only 10% of zinc stores are able to be rapidly turned over, and appear to be rapidly depleted by acute intestinal illness, they are probably best maintained by complementary regular supplementation in a primary prevention strategy rather than secondary prevention triggered by acute diarrhea. The assessment of zinc status is challenging and complex without simple, validated measures to facilitate field testing of novel interventions. Zinc bioavailability may be a crucial factor in the success of primary prevention strategies, and a range of options, all still inadequately explored, might be valuable in improving zinc nutrition. Some therapeutic actions of zinc on diarrhea seem attributable to pharmacologic effects, whereas others are related to the reversal of deficiency (ie, nutritional). The distinction between these 2 mechanisms cannot be clarified given the insensitivity of serum zinc to identify subclinical deficiency states. Why zinc seems to be less effective than expected at all ages, and ineffective for secondary prevention of diarrhea in children <12 mo of age, remains unclear. It was concluded that a reframing of the current recommendation is warranted with consideration of how to better optimize and deliver zinc and whether to provide a complementary public health primary prevention zinc strategy. This requires careful consideration of the zinc product to be used as well as strategies for its delivery.", "26447156": "Choline supplementation in children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.\nBACKGROUND: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) are conditions characterized by physical anomalies, neurodevelopmental abnormalities, and neurocognitive deficits, including intellectual, executive, and memory deficits. There are no specific biological treatments for FASDs, but rodent models have shown that prenatal or postnatal choline supplementation reduces cognitive and behavioral deficits. Potential mechanisms include phospholipid production for axonal growth and myelination, acetylcholine enhancement, and epigenetic effects. OBJECTIVE: Our primary goal was to determine whether postnatal choline supplementation has the potential to improve neurocognitive functioning, particularly hippocampal-dependent memory, in children with FASDs. DESIGN: The study was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled pilot trial in children (aged 2.5-5 y at enrollment) with FASDs (n = 60) who received 500 mg choline or a placebo daily for 9 mo. Outcome measures were Mullen Scales of Early Learning (primary) and the elicited imitation (EI) memory paradigm (secondary). RESULTS: The administration proved feasible, and choline was well tolerated. Participants received a dose on 88% of enrolled days. The only adverse event linked to choline was a fishy body odor. Choline supplementation improved the secondary outcome (EI) only after immediate recall performance was controlled for, and the outcome was moderated by age. The treatment effect on EI items recalled was significant in the younger participants (2.5- to \u22644.0-y-olds); the young choline group showed an increase of 12-14 percentage points greater than that of the young placebo group on delayed recall measures during treatment. However, there was a marginal baseline difference in delayed item recall between the young choline and placebo groups as well as a potential ceiling effect for item recall, both of which likely contributed to the observed treatment effect. We also observed a trend toward a negative effect of choline supplementation on the immediate EI recall of ordered pairs; the young placebo group showed an increase of 8-17 percentage points greater than that of the choline group during treatment. There was an inverse relation between choline dose (in mg/kg) and memory improvement (P = 0.041); the data suggest that weight-adjusted doses may be a better alternative to a fixed dose in future studies. Limitations included trend-level baseline differences in performance, the post-hoc determination of age moderation, and potential ceiling effects for the memory measure. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study suggests that an additional evaluation of choline supplementation as an intervention for memory functioning in children with FASDs is warranted. The observed interaction between age and choline's effect on EI suggests that potential sensitive periods should be considered in future work. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01149538.", "26718412": "Coenzyme Q10 prevents hepatic fibrosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress in a male rat model of poor maternal nutrition and accelerated postnatal growth.\nBACKGROUND: It is well established that low birth weight and accelerated postnatal growth increase the risk of liver dysfunction in later life. However, molecular mechanisms underlying such developmental programming are not well characterized, and potential intervention strategies are poorly defined. OBJECTIVES: We tested the hypotheses that poor maternal nutrition and accelerated postnatal growth would lead to increased hepatic fibrosis (a pathological marker of liver dysfunction) and that postnatal supplementation with the antioxidant coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) would prevent this programmed phenotype. DESIGN: A rat model of maternal protein restriction was used to generate low-birth-weight offspring that underwent accelerated postnatal growth (termed \"recuperated\"). These were compared with control rats. Offspring were weaned onto standard feed pellets with or without dietary CoQ10 (1 mg/kg body weight per day) supplementation. At 12 mo, hepatic fibrosis, indexes of inflammation, oxidative stress, and insulin signaling were measured by histology, Western blot, ELISA, and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Hepatic collagen deposition (diameter of deposit) was greater in recuperated offspring (mean \u00b1 SEM: 12 \u00b1 2 \u03bcm) than in controls (5 \u00b1 0.5 \u03bcm) (P < 0.001). This was associated with greater inflammation (interleukin 6: 38% \u00b1 24% increase; P < 0.05; tumor necrosis factor \u03b1: 64% \u00b1 24% increase; P < 0.05), lipid peroxidation (4-hydroxynonenal, measured by ELISA: 0.30 \u00b1 0.02 compared with 0.19 \u00b1 0.05 \u03bcg/mL per \u03bcg protein; P < 0.05), and hyperinsulinemia (P < 0.05). CoQ10 supplementation increased (P < 0.01) hepatic CoQ10 concentrations and ameliorated liver fibrosis (P < 0.001), inflammation (P < 0.001), some measures of oxidative stress (P < 0.001), and hyperinsulinemia (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Suboptimal in utero nutrition combined with accelerated postnatal catch-up growth caused more hepatic fibrosis in adulthood, which was associated with higher indexes of oxidative stress and inflammation and hyperinsulinemia. CoQ10 supplementation prevented liver fibrosis accompanied by downregulation of oxidative stress, inflammation, and hyperinsulinemia.", "26718415": "Leucine partially protects muscle mass and function during bed rest in middle-aged adults.\nBACKGROUND: Physical inactivity triggers a rapid loss of muscle mass and function in older adults. Middle-aged adults show few phenotypic signs of aging yet may be more susceptible to inactivity than younger adults. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to determine whether leucine, a stimulator of translation initiation and skeletal muscle protein synthesis (MPS), can protect skeletal muscle health during bed rest. DESIGN: We used a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess changes in skeletal MPS, cellular signaling, body composition, and skeletal muscle function in middle-aged adults (n = 19; age \u00b1 SEM: 52 \u00b1 1 y) in response to leucine supplementation (LEU group: 0.06 g \u2219 kg(-1) \u2219 meal(-1)) or an alanine control (CON group) during 14 d of bed rest. RESULTS: Bed rest decreased postabsorptive MPS by 30% \u00b1 9% (CON group) and by 10% \u00b1 10% (LEU group) (main effect for time, P < 0.05), but no differences between groups with respect to pre-post changes (group \u00d7 time interactions) were detected for MPS or cell signaling. Leucine protected knee extensor peak torque (CON compared with LEU group: -15% \u00b1 2% and -7% \u00b1 3%; group \u00d7 time interaction, P < 0.05) and endurance (CON compared with LEU: -14% \u00b1 3% and -2% \u00b1 4%; group \u00d7 time interaction, P < 0.05), prevented an increase in body fat percentage (group \u00d7 time interaction, P < 0.05), and reduced whole-body lean mass loss after 7 d (CON compared with LEU: -1.5 \u00b1 0.3 and -0.8 \u00b1 0.3 kg; group \u00d7 time interaction, P < 0.05) but not 14 d (CON compared with LEU: -1.5 \u00b1 0.3 and -1.0 \u00b1 0.3 kg) of bed rest. Leucine also maintained muscle quality (peak torque/kg leg lean mass) after 14 d of bed-rest inactivity (CON compared with LEU: -9% \u00b1 2% and +1% \u00b1 3%; group \u00d7 time interaction, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Bed rest has a profoundly negative effect on muscle metabolism, mass, and function in middle-aged adults.

Maternal supplementation beginning in gestation is a potential alternative, but its efficacy in maintaining infant 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration after birth is unknown. OBJECTIVES: We determined the effect of 3 doses of maternal vitamin D supplementation beginning in gestation and continued in lactation on infant serum 25(OH)D and compared the prevalence of infant serum 25(OH)D cutoffs (>30, >40, >50, and >75 nmol/L) by dose at 8 wk of age. DESIGN: Pregnant women (n = 226) were randomly allocated to receive 10, 25, or 50 \u03bcg vitamin D\u2083/d from 13 to 24 wk of gestation until 8 wk postpartum, with no infant supplementation. Mother and infant blood was collected at 8 wk postpartum. RESULTS: At 8 wk postpartum, mean [nmol/L (95% CI)] infant 25(OH)D at 8 wk was higher in the 50-\u03bcg/d [75 (67, 83)] than in the 25-\u03bcg/d [52 (45, 58)] or 10-\u03bcg/d [45 (38, 52)] vitamin D groups (P < 0.05). Fewer infants born to mothers in the 50-\u03bcg/d group had a 25(OH)D concentration <30 nmol/L (indicative of deficiency) than infants in the 25- and 10-\u03bcg/d groups, respectively (2% compared with 16% and 43%; P < 0.05). Fewer than 15% of infants in the 10- or 25-\u03bcg/d groups achieved a 25(OH)D concentration >75 nmol/L compared with 44% in the 50-\u03bcg/d group (P < 0.05). Almost all infants (\u223c98%, n = 44) born to mothers in the 50-\u03bcg/d group achieved a 25(OH)D concentration >30 nmol/L. At 8 wk postpartum, mean maternal 25(OH)D concentration was higher in the 50-\u03bcg/d [88 (84, 91)] than in the 25-\u03bcg/d [78 (74, 81)] or 10-\u03bcg/d [69 (66, 73)] groups (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Maternal supplementation beginning in gestation with 50 \u03bcg vitamin D\u2083/d protects 98% of unsupplemented breastfed infants against 25(OH)D deficiency (<30 nmol/L) to at least 8 wk, whereas 10 or 25 \u03bcg vitamin D/d protects only 57% and 84% of infants, respectively.", "25629818": "Modulation of Intestinal Epithelial Defense Responses by Probiotic Bacteria.\nProbiotics are live microorganisms, which when administered in food confer numerous health benefits. In previous studies about beneficial effects of probiotic bacteria to health, particularly in the fields of intestinal mucosa defense responses, specific probiotics, in a strain-dependent manner, show certain degree of potential to reinforce the integrity of intestinal epithelium and/or regulate some immune components. The mechanism of probiotic action is an area of interest. Among all possible routes of modulation by probiotics of intestinal epithelial cell-mediated defense responses, modulations of intestinal barrier function, innate, and adaptive mucosal immune responses, as well as signaling pathways are considered to play important role in the intestinal defense responses against pathogenic bacteria. This review summarizes the beneficial effects of probiotic bacteria to intestinal health together with the mechanisms affected by probiotic bacteria: barrier function, innate, and adaptive defense responses such as secretion of mucins, defensins, trefoil factors, immunoglobulin A (IgA), Toll-like receptors (TLRs), cytokines, gut associated lymphoid tissues, and signaling pathways.", "25057156": "Cardiovascular disease and vitamin D supplementation: trial analysis, systematic review, and meta-analysis.\nBACKGROUND: Low 25-hydroxyvitamin D status has been associated with increased cardiovascular events in epidemiologic studies. OBJECTIVE: We assessed whether vitamin D supplementation reduces cardiac failure, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke through an analysis of the Randomised Evaluation of Calcium Or vitamin D (RECORD) randomized controlled trial (RCT), a systematic review, and a meta-analysis. DESIGN: Two analyses were undertaken. The first analysis was a trial analysis. The RECORD was a factorial RCT that compared vitamin D\u2083 (800 IU/d), calcium (1000 mg/d), vitamin D plus calcium, and a placebo. Cardiovascular events were collected throughout the trial and 3-y posttrial follow-up. Data were analyzed by using Cox regression. The second analysis was a systematic review. MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, conference abstracts, and ongoing trials were searched for RCTs that evaluated vitamin D from 1980 to 2013. RCTs with \u22651 y of follow-up and participants mean or median age \u226560 y were included. Meta-analyses were based on a Bayesian fixed-effects model by using a complementary log-log link function to account for varying lengths of follow-up. RESULTS: In the trial analysis, we showed that, for the 5292 participants in the RECORD trial, HRs (95% CIs) for vitamin D compared with no vitamin D for cardiac failure, MI, and stroke were 0.75 (0.58, 0.97), 0.97 (0.75,1.26), and 1.06 (0.8, 1.32), respectively. Twenty-one studies met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review (n = 13,033). Estimated HRs (credible intervals) for vitamin D compared with the placebo or control for on-study events for cardiac failure, MI, and stroke were 0.82 (0.58, 1.15), 0.96 ( 0.83, 1.10), and 1.07 (0.91, 1.29), respectively.

Vegetarians, by definition, do not eat fish and thus consume virtually no EPA and DHA. Because conversion of the plant-derived n-3 fatty acid \u03b1-linolenic acid (ALA) to EPA and DHA is very low, n-3 tissue concentrations in vegetarians are lower than in omnivores. This review asks 2 questions: what is the evidence that increased n-3 concentrations reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease in vegetarians, and, if it does, how can vegetarians increase their blood and tissue concentrations of these animal-derived fatty acids? At present, both cardiovascular risk markers and cardiovascular events appear to be significantly reduced in vegetarians compared with those in omnivores. If so, and in the absence of data to show that risk in vegetarians could be even lower with higher n-3 concentrations, then the second question becomes moot. However, the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence; therefore, at our present state of knowledge, increasing n-3 concentrations is not an unreasonable goal for vegetarians. This can be accomplished by a variety of approaches, including increased intakes of ALA, consumption of stearidonic acid-enriched soybean oil (if and when it comes to the market), and the use of supplements containing EPA, DHA, or both derived from nonanimal sources (microalgae, biotech yeast, and, in the future, biotech plant oils).", "26040641": "Association of dietary phosphate and serum phosphorus concentration by levels of kidney function.\nBACKGROUND: The health implications of dietary phosphorus intake and the role of kidney function in managing serum phosphorus homeostasis are well studied. However, examining the source of dietary phosphorus intake and its impact on serum phosphorus has not been characterized in population studies. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to distinguish the association of food sources of organic phosphorus and inorganic phosphate additives with serum phosphorus concentration. DESIGN: A cross-sectional analysis of 24-h food recall data from 7895 adult participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003-2006 was performed. Phosphorus content of foods was categorized as organic or inorganic. Correlations of serum phosphorus to clinical and dietary intake variables were achieved by using multiple regression analysis. RESULTS: After controlling for estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), body mass index (BMI; in kg/m\u00b2), and albumin-to-creatinine ratio, a significant increase in serum phosphorus occurred with dairy foods with inorganic phosphates [parameter estimate (PE) \u00b1 SE: 0.07 \u00b1 0.02 mg/dL, P < 0.01] or without inorganic phosphates (PE: 0.02 \u00b1 0.01, P < 0.001) and cereals/grains with inorganic phosphates (PE: 0.005 \u00b1 0.002, P < 0.01). Significantly higher serum phosphorus occurred when eGRF was <30 (PE: 0.24 \u00b1 0.08, P < 0.0001), but eGFR 30-44 (PE: -0.11 \u00b1 0.04, P < 0.01) and 45-60 (PE: -0.10 \u00b1 0.04, P < 0.01) were associated with lower serum phosphorus; higher serum phosphorus was associated with BMI <18.5 (PE: 0.18 \u00b1 0.05, P = 0.0009) but lower with BMI \u226535-39 (PE: -0.09 \u00b1 0.03, P = 0.0013) or \u226540 (PE: -0.10 \u00b1 0.03, P = 0.014).

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to quantitatively evaluate the effects of resveratrol on glucose control and insulin sensitivity. DESIGN: We performed a strategic literature search of PubMed, Embase, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Library (updated to March 2014) for randomized controlled trials that estimated the effects of resveratrol on glucose control and insulin sensitivity. Study quality was assessed by using the Jadad scale. Weighted mean differences were calculated for net changes in glycemic measures by using fixed-effects or random-effects models. We performed prespecified subgroup and sensitivity analyses to evaluate potential heterogeneity. Meta-regression analyses were conducted to investigate dose effects of resveratrol on fasting glucose and insulin concentrations in nondiabetic subjects. RESULTS: Eleven studies comprising a total of 388 subjects were included in this meta-analysis. Resveratrol consumption significantly reduced fasting glucose, insulin, glycated hemoglobin, and insulin resistance (measured by using the homeostatic model assessment) levels in participants with diabetes. No significant effect of resveratrol on glycemic measures of nondiabetic participants was found in the meta-analysis. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses indicated that the pooled effects of resveratrol on fasting glucose and insulin concentrations in nondiabetic participants were not affected by body mass index, study design, resveratrol dose, study duration, or Jadad score.

In 2001, a report of the FAO and WHO (2001 Oct, http://www.who.int/foodsafety/publications/fs_-management/en/probiotics.pdf) proposed a more restrictive definition of probiotic, as follows: \"a live micro-organism which, when administered in adequate amounts, confers a health benefit on the host.\" As such, answering the fundamental question posed here-\"Is human milk a probiotic?\"-requires first grappling with the concept and meaning of the term probiotic. Nonetheless, one must also be convinced that human milk contains bacteria. Indeed, there are scores of publications providing evidence of a paradigm shift in this regard. Variation in the human-milk microbiome may be associated with maternal weight, mode of delivery, lactation state, gestation age, antibiotic use, and maternal health. Milk constituents (e.g., fatty acids and complex carbohydrates) might also be related to the abundance of specific bacterial taxa in milk. Whether these bacteria affect infant health is likely, but more studies are needed to test this hypothesis. In summary, a growing literature suggests that human milk, like all other fluids produced by the body, indeed contains viable bacteria. As such, and recognizing the extensive literature relating breastfeeding to optimal infant health, we propose that human milk should be considered a probiotic food. Determining factors that influence which bacteria are present in milk and if and how they influence the mother's and/or the recipient infant's health remain basic science and public health realms in which almost nothing is known.", "26374177": "Vitamin B-12 and Perinatal Health.\nVitamin B-12 deficiency (<148 pmol/L) is associated with adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes, including developmental anomalies, spontaneous abortions, preeclampsia, and low birth weight (<2500 g). The importance of adequate vitamin B-12 status periconceptionally and during pregnancy cannot be overemphasized, given its fundamental role in neural myelination, brain development, and growth. Infants born to vitamin B-12-deficient women may be at increased risk of neural tube closure defects, and maternal vitamin B-12 insufficiency (<200 pmol/L) can impair infant growth, psychomotor function, and brain development, which may be irreversible. However, the underlying causal mechanisms are unknown. This review was conducted to examine the evidence that links maternal vitamin B-12 status and perinatal outcomes. Despite the high prevalence of vitamin B-12 deficiency and associated risk of pregnancy complications, few prospective studies and, to our knowledge, only 1 randomized trial have examined the effects of vitamin B-12 supplementation during pregnancy. The role of vitamin B-12 in the etiology of adverse perinatal outcomes needs to be elucidated to inform public health interventions.", "25897620": "Effects of quercetin supplementation on lipid profile: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.\nBACKGROUND: In spite of promising experimental findings, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have yielded mixed results on the impact of quercetin supplementation on plasma lipid levels. AIM: The present study aimed to quantify the effects of quercetin on plasma lipids using a meta-analysis of RCTs. METHODS: A systematic literature search of Medline was conducted for RCTs that investigated the efficacy of quercetin supplementation on plasma lipids comprising total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides. Weighted mean differences (WMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for net changes in lipid concentrations using a random-effects model. Meta-regression analysis was conducted to assess the effect of quercetin dose and duration of supplementation as moderators on the calculated effect measures. RESULTS: Five RCTs totaling 442 subjects (221 in the quercetin and 221 in the control group) fulfilled the eligibility criteria and selected for analyses. Combined estimate of effect size for the impact of quercetin on plasma LDL-C (WMD: 1.43\u00a0mg/dL, 95% CI: -0.92-3.78, p = 0.23), HDL-C (WMD: 0.26\u00a0mg/dL, 95% CI: -0.74-1.25, p = 0.61) and triglycerides (WMD: -9.42\u00a0mg/dL, 95% CI: -27.80-8.96, p = 0.32) was not statistically significant. However, a borderline significant but clinically non-relevant increase in total cholesterol was observed (WMD: 3.13\u00a0mg/dL, 95% CI: -0.01-6.27, p = 0.05). When the analysis was confined to the subgroups of studies with quercetin doses \u2265500\u00a0mg/day and follow-up of \u2265 4\u00a0weeks, a significant increase in total cholesterol (WMD: 3.57\u00a0mg/dL, 95% CI: 0.21-6.92, p = 0.04) and a decline in triglycerides (WMD: -24.54\u00a0mg/dL, 95% CI: -33.09 to -15.99, p < 0.00001) was observed, but LDL-C and HDL-C concentrations remained unchanged (p > 0.05). Changes in plasma triglycerides, but not other indices of lipid profile, were significantly associated with quercetin dose (slope: -0.057; 95% CI: -0.103 to -0.010; p = 0.02) and duration of supplementation (slope: -5.314; 95% CI: -9.482 to -1.147; p = 0.01). CONCLUSION: Available evidence from RCTs does not suggest any clinically relevant effect of quercetin supplementation on plasma lipids, apart from a significant reduction of triglycerides at doses above 50\u00a0mg/day.", "26462599": "Gut microbiota-bone axis.\nThe gut microbiota (GM) is an important regulator of body homeostasis, including intestinal and extra-intestinal effects. This review focuses on the GM-bone axis, which we define as the effect of the gut-associated microbial community or the molecules they synthesize, on bone health. While research in this field is limited, findings from preclinical studies support that gut microbes positively impact bone mineral density and strength parameters. Moreover, administration of beneficial bacteria (probiotics) in preclinical models has demonstrated higher bone mineralization and greater bone strength. The preferential bacterial genus that has shown these beneficial effects in bone is Lactobacillus and thus lactobacilli are among the best candidates for future clinical intervention trials. However, their effectiveness is dependent on stage of development, as early life constitutes an important time for impacting bone health, perhaps via modulation of the GM. In addition, sex-specific difference also impacts the efficacy of the probiotics. Although auspicious, many questions regarding the GM-bone axis require consideration of potential mechanisms; sex-specific efficacy; effective dose of probiotics; and timing and duration of treatment.", "26178731": "A randomized controlled trial of green tea catechins in protection against ultraviolet radiation-induced cutaneous inflammation.\nBACKGROUND: Safe systemic protection from the health hazards of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) in sunlight is desirable. Green tea is consumed globally and is reported to have anti-inflammatory properties, which may be mediated through the impact on cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways. Recent data suggest that green tea catechins (GTCs) reduce acute UVR effects, but human trials examining their photoprotective potential are scarce. OBJECTIVE: We performed a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to examine whether GTCs protect against clinical, histologic, and biochemical indicators of UVR-induced inflammation. DESIGN: Healthy adults (aged 18-65 y, phototypes I-II) were randomly allocated to 1350 mg encapsulated green tea extract (540 mg GTC) with 50 mg vitamin C or placebo twice daily for 3 mo. Impact on skin erythema, dermal leukocytic infiltration, and concentrations of proinflammatory eicosanoids was assessed after solar-simulated UVR challenge, and subject compliance was determined through assay of urinary GTC metabolite epigallocatechin glucuronide. RESULTS: Volunteers were assigned to the active (n = 25) or the placebo (n = 25) group. After supplementation, median (IQR) sunburn threshold (minimal erythema dose) was 28 (20-28) and 20 (20-28) mJ/cm(2) in the active and placebo groups, respectively (nonsignificant), with no difference in AUC analysis for measured erythema index after a geometric series of 10 UVR doses. Skin immunohistochemistry showed increased neutrophil and CD3(+) T-lymphocyte numbers post-UVR in both groups (P < 0.01) with no statistically significant differences between groups after supplementation. Cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase metabolites prostaglandin E2 (vasodilator) and 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoicacid (chemoattractant), respectively, increased after UVR (P < 0.05), with no differences between supplementation groups. CONCLUSION: Oral GTC (1080 mg/d) with vitamin C over 3 mo did not significantly reduce skin erythema, leukocyte infiltration, or eicosanoid response to UVR inflammatory challenge.

Recently, their antiglycative actions by oxidative stress modulation have been linked to the prevention of diabetes and associated complications. This article assesses the evidence for polyphenol interventions on glycohemoglobin (HbA1c) in non-diabetic, pre-diabetic, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) subjects. A systematic review of polyphenols' clinical trials on HbA1c in humans was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. Thirty-six controlled randomized trials with HbA1c values were included. Polyphenols (extracts, supplements, and foods) were supplemented (28\u00a0mg to 1.5\u00a0g) for 0.7 to 12 months. Combining all subjects (n = 1954, mean baseline HbA1c = 7.03%, 53\u00a0mmol/mol), polyphenol supplementation significantly (P < 0.001) lowered HbA1c% by -0.53 \u00b1 0.12 units (-5.79 \u00b1 0.13\u00a0mmol/mol). This reduction was significant (P < 0.001) in T2DM subjects, specifically (n = 1426, mean baseline HbA1c = 7.44%, 58\u00a0mmol/mol), with HbA1c% lowered by -0.21 \u00b1 0.04 units (-2.29 \u00b1 0.4\u00a0mmol/mol). Polyphenol supplementation had no significant effect (P > 0.21) in the non-diabetic (n = 258, mean baseline HbA1c = 5.47%, 36\u00a0mmol/mol) and the pre-diabetic subjects (n = 270, mean baseline HbA1c = 6.06%, 43\u00a0mmol/mol) strata: -0.39 \u00b1 0.27 HbA1c% units (-4.3 \u00b1 0.3\u00a0mmol/mol), and -0.38 \u00b1 0.31 units (-4.2 \u00b1 0.31\u00a0mmol/mol), respectively. In conclusion, polyphenols can successfully reduce HbA1c in T2DM without any intervention at glycemia, and could contribute to the prevention of diabetes complications.", "25527754": "Dairy products, calcium, and prostate cancer risk: a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies.\nBACKGROUND: Dairy product and calcium intakes have been associated with increased prostate cancer risk, but whether specific dairy products or calcium sources are associated with risk is unclear. OBJECTIVE: In the Continuous Update Project, we conducted a meta-analysis of prospective studies on intakes of dairy products and calcium and prostate cancer risk. DESIGN: PubMed and several other databases were searched up to April 2013. Summary RRs were estimated by using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Thirty-two studies were included. Intakes of total dairy products [summary RR: 1.07 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.12; n = 15) per 400 g/d], total milk [summary RR: 1.03 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.07; n = 14) per 200 g/d], low-fat milk [summary RR: 1.06 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.11; n = 6) per 200 g/d], cheese [summary RR: 1.09 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.18; n = 11) per 50 g/d], and dietary calcium [summary RR: 1.05 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.09; n = 15) per 400 mg/d] were associated with increased total prostate cancer risk. Total calcium and dairy calcium intakes, but not nondairy calcium or supplemental calcium intakes, were also positively associated with total prostate cancer risk. Supplemental calcium was associated with increased risk of fatal prostate cancer. CONCLUSIONS: High intakes of dairy products, milk, low-fat milk, cheese, and total, dietary, and dairy calcium, but not supplemental or nondairy calcium, may increase total prostate cancer risk. The diverging results for types of dairy products and sources of calcium suggest that other components of dairy rather than fat and calcium may increase prostate cancer risk. Any additional studies should report detailed results for subtypes of prostate cancer.", "26237277": "Significance of Increasing n-3 PUFA Content in Pork on Human Health.\nEvidence for the health-promoting effects of food rich in n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) is reviewed. Pork is an important meat source for humans. According to a report by the US Department of Agriculture ( http://www.ers.usda.gov/topics ), the pork consumption worldwide in 2011 was about 79.3 million tons, much higher than that of beef (48.2 million tons). Pork also contains high levels of unsaturated fatty acids relative to ruminant meats (Enser, M., Hallett, K., Hewett, B., Fursey, G. A. J. and Wood, J. D. (1996) . Fatty acid content and composition of English beef, lamb, and pork at retail. Meat Sci. 44:443-458). The available literature indicates that the levels of eicosatetraenoic and docosahexaenoic in pork may be increased by fish-derived or linseed products, the extent of which being dependent on the nature of the supplementation. Transgenic pigs and plants show promise with high content of n-3 PUFA and low ratio of n-6/n-3 fatty acids in their tissues. The approaches mentioned for decreasing n-6/n-3 ratios have both advantages and disadvantages.

Classically, the nutrients (water, protein, lipid, carbohydrate, vitamins, and minerals) were studied as the critical components of milk serving the growth needs of the infant for optimum growth. However, human milk contains factors other than the classically defined nutrients for which researchers are investigating potential roles in infant and maternal health, development, and well-being. The symposium addressed some of the exciting factors being studied, including microbes and maternal cells found within milk. Drs. Michelle McGuire and Juan M. Rodr\u00edguez addressed the presence of a bacterial community in human milk produced by healthy and mastitic mothers, potential sources of those bacteria, and the impact of milk-derived bacteria on the nursing infant. Drs. Donna Geddes, Peter Hartmann, and Foteini Hassiotou discussed the potential importance of maternal cells. For years, immune cells were known to be present in human milk, but recent evidence suggests that their impact is as much on the infant as on the health of the lactating mammary gland.

Animal models have demonstrated the importance of adequate nutrition for the neurodevelopmental processes that occur rapidly during pregnancy and infancy, such as neuron proliferation and myelination. However, several factors influence whether nutrient deficiencies during this period cause permanent cognitive deficits in human populations, including the child's interaction with the environment, the timing and degree of nutrient deficiency, and the possibility of recovery. These factors should be taken into account in the design and interpretation of future research. Certain types of nutritional deficiency clearly impair brain development, including severe acute malnutrition, chronic undernutrition, iron deficiency, and iodine deficiency. While strategies such as salt iodization and micronutrient powders have been shown to improve these conditions, direct evidence of their impact on brain development is scarce. Other strategies also require further research, including supplementation with iron and other micronutrients, essential fatty acids, and fortified food supplements during pregnancy and infancy.", "26537943": "Long-term effect of high-dose supplementation with DHA on visual function at school age in children born at <33 wk gestational age: results from a follow-up of a randomized controlled trial.\nBACKGROUND: Children born preterm are at risk of visual-processing impairments. Several lines of evidence have contributed to the rationale that docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) supplementation of preterm infants may improve outcomes in visual processing. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to determine whether at 7 y of age children who were born very preterm and who received a high-DHA diet have better visual-processing outcomes than do infants fed a standard-DHA diet. DESIGN: This was a follow-up study in a subgroup of children from a randomized controlled trial. Infants were randomly assigned to milk containing a higher concentration of DHA (1% of total fatty acids; high-DHA group) or a standard amount of DHA (0.2-0.3% of total fatty acids as DHA; control group). The randomization schedule was stratified by sex and birth weights of <1250 or \u22651250 g. A total of 104 (49 in the high-DHA group and 55 in the standard-DHA group) children aged 7 y were assessed on a range of visual-processing measures, including visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, vernier acuity, binocular stereopsis, and visual perception. RESULTS: There was no evidence of differences between the high-DHA and standard-DHA groups in any of the visual-processing measures. In the majority (12 of 13) of variables assessed, the direction of effect favored the control group. The study was large enough to detect a moderate treatment effect, if one truly existed. CONCLUSION: Supplementing human milk with DHA at a dose of \u223c1% of total fatty acids given in the first months of life to very preterm infants does not appear to confer any long-term benefit for visual processing at school age.

The majority of the novel techniques are being implemented for the identification and characterization of microorganisms used for probiotic application. Standard microbial techniques such as biochemical testing and culture techniques routinely used for probiotic microbes screening, identification and selection. However, these standard techniques may not give complete information on the microbes that can be used for probiotic production. Furthermore, alternative molecular and analytical techniques such as 16S and 23S ribosomal DNA sequencing, RNA analysis by reverse transcriptase (RT-PCR), fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), quantitative analysis by real time PCR (RT-PCR or qPCR) and fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) are potentially used to confirm and select all types of lactic acid microorganism.

Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have been used to treat DES; however, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of PUFA therapy yield discordant results. The objective of this study was to clarify the effects of PUFAs on DES through meta-analysis of all relevant RCTs. To do so, a comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, ISI Web of Science, and unpublished data was conducted. The changes in clinical and laboratory examinations, symptomatic scores, and rates of relevant symptoms were analyzed. Nine RCTs were included in the current meta-analysis. Compared with placebo, PUFA supplementation was not related to changes in tear film break-up time (weighted mean difference [WMD], 0.33; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.05 to 0.72), Schirmer's test score (WMD, 0.32; 95%CI, -0.23 to 0.86), or lissamine green staining score (WMD, -0.77; 95%CI, -1.66 to 0.12). However, significant reductions were detected in the symptom score on the ocular surface disease index (WMD, -2.26; 95%CI, -4.44 to -0.08) and in the rate of cells positive for human leukocyte antigen DR (WMD, -5.80; 95%CI, -8.62 to -2.97).

Low vitamin D concentrations in pregnancy are widespread worldwide, and vitamin D deficiency is implicated in immune cell regulation at the feto-maternal interface and several diseases of pregnancy. OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether 25-hydroxyvitamin D serum concentration was a modifiable risk factor for early miscarriage. DESIGN: In a prospective cohort study of 1683 pregnant women donating serum before gestational week 22, we investigated the association between maternal serum concentrations of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and the risk of subsequent miscarriage (n = 58). RESULTS: The adjusted hazard of first-trimester miscarriage was lower with higher 25(OH)D concentrations (HR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.96, 0.99). Concentrations of 25(OH)D <50 nmol/L were associated with a >2-fold increased adjusted HR for miscarriage (HR: 2.50; 95% CI: 1.10, 5.69). Concentrations of 25(OH)D were not associated with an increased risk of second-trimester miscarriage. CONCLUSIONS: We found an association between 25(OH)D and first-trimester miscarriages, suggesting vitamin D as a modifiable risk factor for miscarriage. To test this hypothesis, randomized controlled trials should investigate the possible effect of vitamin D supplementation to increase 25(OH)D concentrations in early pregnancy, or before conception, to decrease risk of miscarriage.

In selenium deficiency, benign strains of Coxsackie and influenza viruses can mutate to highly pathogenic strains. Dietary supplementation to provide adequate or supranutritional selenium supply has been proposed to confer health benefits for patients suffering from some viral diseases, most notably with respect to HIV and influenza A virus (IAV) infections. In addition, selenium-containing multimicronutrient supplements improved several clinical and lifestyle variables in patients coinfected with HIV and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Selenium status may affect the function of cells of both adaptive and innate immunity. Supranutritional selenium promotes proliferation and favors differentiation of naive CD4-positive T lymphocytes toward T helper 1 cells, thus supporting the acute cellular immune response, whereas excessive activation of the immune system and ensuing host tissue damage are counteracted through directing macrophages toward the M2 phenotype. This review provides an up-to-date overview on selenium in infectious diseases caused by viruses (e.g., HIV, IAV, hepatitis C virus, poliovirus, West Nile virus) and bacteria (e.g., M. tuberculosis, Helicobacter pylori). Data from epidemiologic studies and intervention trials, with selenium alone or in combination with other micronutrients, and animal experiments are discussed against the background of dietary selenium requirements to alter immune functions.", "24695896": "Dietary calcium does not interact with vitamin D\u2083 in terms of determining the response and catabolism of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D during winter in older adults.\nBACKGROUND: Interactions between calcium and vitamin D may have implications for the regulation of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and its catabolism and, consequently, the vitamin D dietary requirement. OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether different calcium intakes influenced serum 25(OH)D and indexes of vitamin D activation and catabolism during winter and in the context of both adequate and inadequate vitamin D intakes. DESIGN: A 15-wk winter-based, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind vitamin D\u2083 intervention (20 \u03bcg/d) study was carried out in free-living men and women aged \u226550 y (n = 125) who were stratified according to calcium intakes [moderate-low (<700 mg/d) or high (>1000 mg/d) intake]. The serum 25(OH)D concentration was the primary outcome, and serum calcium, parathyroid hormone (PTH), 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)\u2082D], 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [24,25(OH)\u2082D], the ratio of 24,25(OH)\u2082D to 25(OH)D, vitamin D-binding protein, and free 25(OH)D were exploratory outcomes. RESULTS: A repeated-measures ANOVA showed there was no significant (P = 0.2) time \u00d7 vitamin D treatment \u00d7 calcium intake grouping interaction effect on the mean serum 25(OH)D concentration over the 15-wk intervention period. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations increased (P \u2264 0.005) and decreased (P \u2264 0.002) in vitamin D\u2083 and placebo groups, respectively, and were of similar magnitudes in subjects with calcium intakes <700 mg/d (and even <550 mg/d) compared with >1000 mg/d. The response of serum PTH, 1,25(OH)\u2082D, 24,25(OH)\u2082D, the ratio of 24,25(OH)\u2082D to 25(OH)D, and free 25(OH)D significantly differed in vitamin D\u2083 and placebo groups but not by calcium intake grouping.

DATA SOURCES: The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, PsycINFO, and PsycARTICLES databases were searched electronically for studies published up to July 17, 2014. Reference lists of relevant articles were searched manually. STUDY SELECTION: Only double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled human trials that used a standardized, validated scale to assess the effects of probiotic interventions compared with placebo on psychological outcomes or symptoms of psychiatric disorders were included. DATA EXTRACTION: Two researchers independently assessed trials and evaluated them for methodological quality. Data were extracted from the included studies using a data extraction form.

Surprisingly, there is very little data on factors that affect absorption of this fat-soluble vitamin, although it is acknowledged that dietary vitamin D could help to fight against the subdeficient vitamin D status that is common in several populations. This review describes the state of the art concerning the fate of vitamin D in the human upper gastrointestinal tract and on the factors assumed to affect its absorption efficiency. The main conclusions are: (i) ergocalciferol (vitamin D2), the form mostly used in supplements and fortified foods, is apparently absorbed with similar efficiency to cholecalciferol (vitamin D3, the main dietary form), (ii) 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD), the metabolite produced in the liver, and which can be found in foods, is better absorbed than the nonhydroxy vitamin D forms cholecalciferol and ergocalciferol, (iii) the amount of fat with which vitamin D is ingested does not seem to significantly modify the bioavailability of vitamin D3, (iv) the food matrix has apparently little effect on vitamin D bioavailability, (v) sucrose polyesters (Olestra) and tetrahydrolipstatin (orlistat) probably diminish vitamin D absorption, and (vi) there is apparently no effect of aging on vitamin D absorption efficiency. We also find that there is insufficient, or even no data on the following factors suspected of affecting vitamin D bioavailability: (i) effect of type and amount of dietary fiber, (ii) effect of vitamin D status, and (iii) effect of genetic variation in proteins involved in its intestinal absorption. In conclusion, further studies are needed to improve our knowledge of factors affecting vitamin D absorption efficiency.

Consequently, new approaches, including food-based strategies, may be an alternative approach to improving omega-3 status and the health of public sectors. This paper sets out to discuss and review how the use of novel food vehicle and delivery advancements may be used to improve omega-3 status, which may have wider benefits for public health and well-being.", "24646819": "Probiotics in obese pregnancy do not reduce maternal fasting glucose: a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial (Probiotics in Pregnancy Study).\nBACKGROUND: Recent studies have reported beneficial effects of probiotics on maternal glycemia in healthy pregnant women. Obesity significantly increases risk of impaired glucose tolerance in pregnancy, but glycemic effects of probiotics in this specific obstetric group require additional investigation. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the Probiotics in Pregnancy Study was to investigate the effect of a probiotic capsule on maternal fasting glucose in obese pregnant women. DESIGN: In this placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized trial, 175 pregnant women with an early pregnancy body mass index (BMI; in kg/m\u00b2) from 30.0 to 39.9 were recruited from antenatal clinics at the National Maternity Hospital, Dublin, Ireland. Exclusion criteria were BMI <30.0 or >39.9, prepregnancy or gestational diabetes, age <18 y, multiple pregnancy, and fetal anomaly. Women were randomly assigned to receive either a daily probiotic or a placebo capsule from 24 to 28 wk of gestation in addition to routine antenatal care. The primary outcome was the change in fasting glucose between groups from preintervention to postintervention. Secondary outcomes were the incidence of gestational diabetes and neonatal anthropometric measures. RESULTS: In 138 women who completed the study (63 women in the probiotic group; 75 women in the placebo group), mean (\u00b1SD) early pregnancy BMI was 33.6 \u00b1 2.6, which differed significantly between probiotic (32.9 \u00b1 2.4) and placebo (34.1 \u00b1 2.7) groups. With adjustment for BMI, the change in maternal fasting glucose did not differ significantly between treated and control groups [-0.09 \u00b1 0.27 compared with -0.07 \u00b1 0.39 mmol/L; P = 0.391; B = -0.05 (95% CI: -0.17, 0.07)]. There were also no differences in the incidence of impaired glycemia (16% in the probiotic group compared with 15% in the placebo group; P = 0.561), birth weight (3.70 kg in the probiotic group compared with 3.68 kg in the placebo group; P = 0.723), or other metabolic variables or pregnancy outcomes. A secondary analysis of 110 women, excluding antibiotic users and poor compliers, also revealed no differences in maternal glucose or other outcomes between groups.

At large scale, the FOS are produced by microbial enzymes from sucrose. A mixture of FOS and other saccharides is obtained in this process. The presence of such saccharides reduces the prebiotic, caloric, and cariogenic value of the final product. Therefore, many efforts have been conducted to obtain a product with increased FOS purity.

OBJECTIVE: We compared 12 mo of vitamin D3 supplementation with placebo on weight, body composition, insulin, and C-reactive protein (CRP) in postmenopausal women in a weight-loss intervention. DESIGN: A total of 218 overweight/obese women (50-75 y of age) with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] \u226510 ng/mL but <32 ng/mL were randomly assigned to weight loss + 2000 IU oral vitamin D3/d or weight loss + daily placebo. The weight-loss intervention included a reduced-calorie diet (10% weight loss goal) and 225 min/wk of moderate-to-vigorous aerobic activity. Mean 12-mo changes in weight, body composition, serum insulin, CRP, and 25(OH)D were compared between groups (intent-to-treat) by using generalized estimating equations. RESULTS: A total of 86% of participants completed the 12-mo measurements. The mean (95% CI) change in 25(OH)D was 13.6 (11.6, 15.4) ng/mL in the vitamin D3 arm compared with -1.3 (-2.6, -0.3) ng/mL in the placebo arm (P < 0.0001). Changes in weight [-7.1 (-8.7, -5.7) compared with -7.4 (-8.1, -5.4) kg], body mass index (in kg/m(2): both -2.8), waist circumference [-4.9 (-6.7, -2.9) compared with -4.5 (-5.6, -2.6) cm], percentage body fat [-4.1 (-4.9, -2.9) compared with -3.5 (-4.5, -2.5)], trunk fat [-4.1 (-4.7, -3.0) compared with -3.7 (-4.3, -2.9) kg], insulin [-2.5 (-3.4, -1.7) compared with -2.4 (-3.3, -1.4) \u03bcU/mL], and CRP [-0.9 (-1.2, -0.6) compared with -0.79 (-0.9, -0.4) mg/L] [corrected] were similar between groups (all P > 0.05). Compared with women who achieved 25(OH)D <32 ng/mL, women randomly assigned to vitamin D who became replete (ie, 25(OH)D \u226532 ng/mL) lost more weight [-8.8 (-11.1, -6.9) compared with -5.6 (-7.2, -5.0) kg; P = 0.05], waist circumference [-6.6 (-9.3, -4.3) compared with -2.5 (-4.6, -2.0) cm; P = 0.02], and percentage body fat [-4.7 (-6.1, -3.5) compared with -2.6 (-3.9, -2.2); P = 0.04]. Among women with complete pill counts (97% adherence), the mean decrease in CRP was 1.18 mg/mL (46%) in the vitamin D arm compared with 0.46 mg/mL (25%) in the placebo arm (P = 0.03).

Two recent reports addressed the cumulative epidemiological evidence for this association but expressed conflicting opinions. Here, the evidence is reviewed in relation to Sir Austin Bradford Hill's criteria for assessing \"causality,\" and the latest meta-analysis of the effects of homocysteine-lowering on cognitive function is critically examined. The meta-analysis included 11 trials, collectively assessing 22,000 individuals, that examined the effects of B vitamin supplements (folic acid, vitamin B12, vitamin B6) on global or domain-specific cognitive decline. It concluded that homocysteine-lowering with B vitamin supplements has no significant effect on cognitive function. However, careful examination of the trials in the meta-analysis indicates that no conclusion can be made regarding the effects of homocysteine-lowering on cognitive decline, since the trials typically did not include individuals who were experiencing such decline. Further definitive trials in older adults experiencing cognitive decline are still urgently needed.", "25022989": "Supplemental substances derived from foods as adjunctive therapeutic agents for treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and disorders.\nNeurodegenerative disorders and diseases (NDDs) that are either chronically acquired or triggered by a singular detrimental event are a rapidly growing cause of disability and/or death. In recent times, there have been major advancements in our understanding of various neurodegenerative disease states that have revealed common pathologic features or mechanisms. The many mechanistic parallels discovered between various neurodegenerative diseases suggest that a single therapeutic approach may be used to treat multiple disease conditions. Of late, natural compounds and supplemental substances have become an increasingly attractive option to treat NDDs because there is growing evidence that these nutritional constituents have potential adjunctive therapeutic effects (be it protective or restorative) on various neurodegenerative diseases. Here we review relevant experimental and clinical data on supplemental substances (i.e., curcuminoids, rosmarinic acid, resveratrol, acetyl-L-carnitine, and \u03c9-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids) that have demonstrated encouraging therapeutic effects on chronic diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and neurodegeneration resulting from acute adverse events, such as traumatic brain injury.", "25764389": "Cyclodextrins in Food Technology and Human Nutrition: Benefits and Limitations.\nCyclodextrins are tasteless, odorless, nondigestible, noncaloric, noncariogenic saccharides, which reduce the digestion of carbohydrates and lipids.

They are either non- or only partly digestible by the enzymes of the human gastrointestinal (GI) tract and fermented by the gut microflora. Based on these properties, cyclodextrins are dietary fibers useful for controlling the body weight and blood lipid profile. They are prebiotics, improve the intestinal microflora by selective proliferation of bifidobacteria. These antiobesity and anti-diabetic effects make them bioactive food supplements and nutraceuticals. In this review, these features are evaluated for \u03b1-, \u03b2- and \u03b3-cyclodextrins, which are the cyclodextrin variants approved by authorities for food applications. The mechanisms behind these effects are reviewed together with the applications as solubilizers, stabilizers of dietary lipids, such as unsaturated fatty acids, phytosterols, vitamins, flavonoids, carotenoids and other nutraceuticals.

Fecal specimens were collected between days 16 and 21 for fermentative end-product analysis and 16S ribosomal RNA bacterial gene amplification for bacterial taxa identification. Fiber supplementation decreased fecal putrefaction compounds and shifted abundances of several bacterial taxa. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to perform whole-genome shotgun 454 pyrosequencing on the same fecal specimens collected in that clinical trial to obtain comprehensive fecal bacterial genome sequencing coverage and explore the full range of bacterial genetic information in the fecal microbiome, thereby using a systematic approach to study the impact of dietary fiber supplementation on fecal metabolites, bacterial taxa, and bacterial metagenomes. DESIGN: Fecal samples were subjected to whole-genome shotgun 454 pyrosequencing to identify both fecal bacterial populations present and their functional genetic capacity. RESULTS: Whole-genome shotgun sequencing results revealed that fiber consumption shifted the Bacteroidetes:Firmicutes ratio, increasing the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes 12 \u00b1 2% and 13 \u00b1 2% with polydextrose and SCF, respectively, compared with NFC. Bivariate correlations showed a positive correlation between the Bacteroidetes:Firmicutes ratio and total dietary fiber intake but not body mass index. Principal coordinates analysis of Bray-Curtis distances indicated that bacterial gene composition was more similar in participants consuming fibers (polydextrose and SCF combined) in comparison with NFC. Shifts in bacterial gene abundances after polydextrose and SCF supplementation included genes associated with carbohydrate, amino acid, and lipid metabolism, as well as metabolism of cofactors and vitamins.

A link between diet and CVD is well established, with dietary modification a foundational component of CVD prevention and management. With the discovery of bioactive components beyond the essential nutrients of foods, a new era of nutritional, medical, botanical, physiologic, and analytical sciences has unfolded. The ability to identify, isolate, purify, and deliver single components has expanded the dietary supplement business and health opportunity for consumers. Lycopene is an example of a food component that has attracted attention from scientists as well as food, agriculture, and dietary supplement industries. A major question, however, is whether delivering lycopene through a supplement source is as effective as or more effective than consuming lycopene through whole food sources, specifically the tomato, which is the richest source of lycopene in the Western diet. In this review, we examined clinical trials comparing the efficacy of lycopene supplements with tomato products on intermediate CVD risk factors including oxidative stress, inflammation, endothelial function, blood pressure, and lipid metabolism. Overall, the present review highlights the need for more targeted research; however, at present, the available clinical research supports consuming tomato-based foods as a first-line approach to cardiovascular health. With the exception of blood pressure management where lycopene supplementation was favored, tomato intake provided more favorable results on cardiovascular risk endpoints than did lycopene supplementation. Indeed, future research that is well designed, clinically focused, mechanistically revealing, and relevant to human intake will undoubtedly add to the growing body of knowledge unveiling the promise of tomatoes and/or lycopene supplementation as an integral component of a heart-healthy diet.", "26135351": "Effects of vitamin B-12 supplementation on neurologic and cognitive function in older people: a randomized controlled trial.\nBACKGROUND: Moderate vitamin B-12 deficiency is relatively common in older people. However, there is little robust evidence on the effect of vitamin B-12 supplementation on neurologic and cognitive outcomes in later life. OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether vitamin B-12 supplementation benefits neurologic and cognitive function in moderately vitamin B-12-deficient older people. DESIGN: We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in 7 general practices in South East England, United Kingdom. Study participants were aged \u226575 y and had moderate vitamin B-12 deficiency (serum vitamin B-12 concentrations: 107-210 pmol/L) in the absence of anemia and received 1 mg crystalline vitamin B-12 or a matching placebo as a daily oral tablet for 12 mo. Peripheral motor and sensory nerve conduction, central motor conduction, a clinical neurologic examination, and cognitive function were assessed before and after treatment. RESULTS: A total of 201 participants were enrolled in the trial, and 191 subjects provided outcome data. Compared with baseline, allocation to vitamin B-12 was associated with a 177% increase in serum concentration of vitamin B-12 (641 compared with 231 pmol/L), a 331% increase in serum holotranscobalamin (240 compared with 56 pmol/L), and 17% lower serum homocysteine (14.2 compared with 17.1 \u03bcmol/L). In intention-to-treat analysis of covariance models, with adjustment for baseline neurologic function, there was no evidence of an effect of supplementation on the primary outcome of the posterior tibial compound muscle action potential amplitude at 12 mo (mean difference: -0.2 mV; 95% CI: -0.8, 0.3 mV). There was also no evidence of an effect on any secondary peripheral nerve or central motor function outcome, or on cognitive function or clinical examination. CONCLUSION: Results of the trial do not support the hypothesis that the correction of moderate vitamin B-12 deficiency, in the absence of anemia and of neurologic and cognitive signs or symptoms, has beneficial effects on neurologic or cognitive function in later life.

OBJECTIVE: The objective was to evaluate the effects of antiretroviral therapy and/or lipid-based nutrient supplements (LNSs) on B vitamin concentrations in breast milk from HIV-infected women in Malawi. DESIGN: Breast milk was collected from 537 women recruited within the Breastfeeding, Antiretrovirals, and Nutrition study at 2 or 6 wk and 24 wk postpartum. Women were assigned to receive antiretrovirals and LNSs, antiretrovirals only, LNSs only, or a control. Antiretrovirals and LNSs were given to the mothers from weeks 0 to 28. The antiretrovirals were zidovudine/lamivudine and nelfinavir or lopinavir/ritonavir. LNSs provided 93-118% of the Recommended Dietary Allowances of thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, pyridoxine, and vitamin B-12. Infants were exclusively breastfed. RESULTS: LNSs increased milk concentrations of all vitamins except thiamin, whereas antiretrovirals lowered concentrations of nicotinamide, pyridoxal, and vitamin B-12. Although antiretrovirals alone had no significant effect on riboflavin concentrations, they negatively affected the LNS-induced increase in this vitamin. Thiamin was not influenced by the study interventions. Concentrations of all B vitamins were much lower than usually accepted values. CONCLUSIONS: All B vitamins were low in milk, and all but thiamin were increased by maternal supplementation with LNSs. Antiretrovirals alone decreased concentrations of some B vitamins in milk. When LNS was given in addition to antiretrovirals, the negative effect of antiretrovirals offset the positive effect of LNSs for all vitamins except thiamin.

There is a variety of evidence to support a role for lutein and zeaxanthin in vision. Lutein's role in cognition has only recently been considered. Lutein and its isomer, zeaxanthin, are taken up selectively into eye tissue. Lutein is the predominant carotenoid in human brain tissue. Lutein and zeaxanthin in neural tissue may have biological effects that include antioxidation, anti-inflammation, and structural actions. In addition, lutein and zeaxanthin may be protective against eye disease because they absorb damaging blue light that enters the eye. In pediatric brains, the relative contribution of lutein to the total carotenoids is twice that found in adults, accounting for more than half the concentration of total carotenoids. The greater proportion of lutein in the pediatric brain suggests a need for lutein during neural development as well. In adults, higher lutein status is related to better cognitive performance, and lutein supplementation improves cognition. The evidence to date warrants further investigation into the role of lutein and zeaxanthin in visual and cognitive health throughout the lifespan.", "24941429": "Efficacy of Multivitamin/mineral Supplementation to Reduce Chronic Disease Risk: A Critical Review of the Evidence from Observational Studies and Randomized Controlled Trials.\nWe reviewed recent scientific evidence regarding the effects of multivitamin/mineral (MVM) supplements on risk of chronic diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and age-related eye diseases. Data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational, prospective cohort studies were examined. The majority of scientific studies investigating the use of MVM supplements in chronic disease risk reduction reported no significant effect. However, the largest and longest RCT of MVM supplements conducted to date, the Physicians' Health Study II (PHS II), found a modest and significant reduction in total and epithelial cancer incidence in male physicians, consistent with the Suppl\u00e9mentation en Vitamines et Min\u00e9raux Antioxydants (SU.VI.MAX) trial. In addition, PHS II found a modest and significant reduction in the incidence of nuclear cataract, in agreement with several other RCTs and observational, prospective cohort studies. The effects of MVM use on other subtypes of cataract and age-related macular degeneration remain unclear. Neither RCTs nor prospective cohort studies are without their limitations. The placebo-controlled trial design of RCTs may be inadequate for nutrient interventions, and residual confounding, measurement error, and the possibility of reverse causality are inherent to any observational study. National surveys show that micronutrient inadequacies are widespread in the US and that dietary supplements, of which MVMs are the most common type, help fulfill micronutrient requirements in adults and children.", "26245807": "Impact of equol-producing capacity and soy-isoflavone profiles of supplements on bone calcium retention in postmenopausal women: a randomized crossover trial.\nBACKGROUND: Postmenopausal estrogen depletion is a major contributing factor to bone loss. Soy isoflavones have variable effects on the prevention of postmenopausal bone loss, which is possibly related to the specific isoflavone content or the variable equol-producing capacity of individuals. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine the effects of the content of isoflavones in a soy supplement and the equol-producing ability of the individual on postmenopausal bone calcium retention. DESIGN: The study was a blinded, randomized, crossover intervention trial in 24 postmenopausal women who were prescreened for their ability to convert daidzein to equol. Women were equilibrated with (41)Ca before the intervention. Interventions were 5 soy isoflavone oral supplements (2 doses of a genistein-rich soy supplement and 3 doses of mixed isoflavones in various proportions) and a bisphosphonate (risedronate). Each intervention was given sequentially for 50 d followed by a 50-d washout period. The percentage of bone calcium retention was determined from the change in urinary (41)Ca:calcium. RESULTS: Interventions that ranged from 52 to 220 mg total isoflavones/d increased bone calcium retention between 3.4% and 7.6% (P < 0.05), which was a moderate effect compared with that of risedronate at 15.3% (95% CI: 7.1%, 22.7%; P = 0.0014). The most-effective soy intervention delivered 105.23 mg total isoflavones/d as genistein, daidzein, and glycitein in their natural ratios and increased bone calcium retention by 7.6% (95% CI: 4.9%, 10.2%; P < 0.0001). Genistein, at 52.85 mg/d, increased bone calcium retention by 3.4% (95% CI: 0.5%, 6.2%; P = 0.029); but there was no benefit at higher amounts (113.52 mg/d). There was no difference (P = 0.5) in bone calcium retention between equol producers and nonproducers. CONCLUSION: Soy isoflavones, although not as potent as risedronate, are effective bone-preserving agents in postmenopausal women regardless of their equol-producing status, and mixed isoflavones in their natural ratios are more effective than enriched genistein.

Diversified sociocultural and economic determinants have been identified that limit the dietary intake of vitamin D and enough distribution of sunlight to maintain optimal levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D). Consequently, the world has witnessed a high prevalence of hypovitaminosis D in resource-limited South Asian countries. The purpose of this review is to provide a South Asian perspective of vitamin D status, critically examining India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka, and to shed light on potential determinants (latitude and season, sunshine exposure habits, age, gender, and genetic factors) leading to hypovitaminosis D among a variety of population groups. Literature search was carried out using bibliographic databases \"PubMed,\" \"Google Scholar,\" and \"ScienceDirect.com.\" Serum 25(OH)D level, 20-50 nmol/L, was mainly taken as vitamin D deficiency, and determinants of low serum 25(OH)D concentration of the population under study were also considered. The review concludes that vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent among South Asian populations and global efforts are needed to overcome hypovitaminosis in the region. In addition, dietary diversification, supplementation and fortification of foods with vitamin D, adequate exposure to sunlight, and consumption of animal foods were suggested as viable approaches to maintain 25(OH)D levels for optimal health.", "24695895": "Yogurt, living cultures, and gut health.\nBacteria used to ferment milk to obtain yogurt belong to thermophilic, bile-sensitive species of lactic acid bacteria, which are not ideally suited for survival into the human gut.

Aging is accompanied by a wide array of nutritional deficiencies and health complications associated with under- and overnutrition, including musculoskeletal impairment, immunosenescence, cardiometabolic diseases, and cognitive impairment. Furthermore, yogurt is accessible and convenient to consume by the older population, which makes yogurt consumption a feasible approach to enhance older adults' nutritional status. A limited number of studies have specifically addressed the impact of yogurt on the nutritional and health status of older adults, and most are observational.

This report reviews the etiology and pathophysiology of depression, and explores the role of omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) as a possible treatment. In seeking to understand depression, genetic factors and environmental influences have been extensively investigated. Research has led to several hypotheses for the pathophysiological basis of depression but a definitive pathogenic mechanism, or group thereof, has hitherto remained equivocal. To date, treatment has been based on the monoamine hypothesis and hence, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have been the most widely used class of medication. In the last decade, there has been considerable interest in n-3 PUFAs and their role in depression. These fatty acids are critical for development and function of the central nervous system. Increasing evidence from epidemiological, laboratory, and randomized placebo-controlled trials suggests deficiency of dietary n-3 PUFAs may contribute to development of mood disorders, and supplementation with n-3 PUFAs may provide a new treatment option. Conclusions based on systematic reviews and meta-analyses of published trials to date vary. Research into the effects of n-3 PUFAs on depressed mood is limited. Furthermore, results from such have led to conflicting conclusions regarding the efficacy of n-3 PUFAs in affecting reduction in symptoms of depression. PUFAs are generally well tolerated by adults and children although mild gastrointestinal effects are reported. There is mounting evidence to suggest that n-3 PUFAs play a role in depression and deserve greater research efforts.", "24697258": "Evidence-based evaluation of potential benefits and safety of beta-alanine supplementation for military personnel.\nThis Department of Defense-sponsored evidence-based review evaluates the safety and putative outcomes of enhancement of athletic performance or improved recovery from exhaustion in studies involving beta-alanine alone or in combination with other ingredients. Beta-alanine intervention studies and review articles were collected from 13 databases, and safety information was collected from adverse event reporting portals. Due to the lack of systematic studies involving military populations, all the available literature was assessed with a subgroup analysis of studies on athletes to determine if beta-alanine would be suitable for the military. Available literature provided only limited evidence concerning the benefits of beta-alanine use, and a majority of the studies were not designed to address safety. Overall, the strength of evidence in terms of the potential for risk of bias in the quality of the available literature, consistency, directness, and precision did not support the use of beta-alanine by military personnel.

There has been concern, however, that it may influence blood lipid levels because it is an essential component of very-low-density lipoproteins. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to systematically review, using PRISMA guidelines, the literature pertaining to the effects of choline on body composition and on metabolic, cardiovascular, respiratory, and neurological outcomes in different life stages. DATA SOURCES: The MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central, Web of Science, PubMed, and Google Scholar databases were searched up to July 2014. DATA EXTRACTION: Fifty relevant articles were identified. These comprised trials and cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies that assessed blood levels of choline, dietary intake of choline, and supplementation with choline in a population free of diseases at baseline. DATA SYNTHESIS: There is some observational evidence that choline during pregnancy may be beneficial for the neurological health of the child. In adults, choline may have beneficial effects on cognition, but high-quality (intervention) studies are lacking. Results on the effects of choline on body composition, blood lipids, and cardiovascular health were inconsistent. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence to confirm the suggested effects of choline on health in different stages of life is scarce. Potential effects of choline need to be confirmed by intervention studies.

Studies of iodine status in pregnant women from the United Kingdom (UK) have focused on early gestation (<16 wk). Data on the effect of advancing gestation on urinary iodine excretion are conflicting, with suggestions of both an increase and a decrease. OBJECTIVES: The aims were to evaluate iodine status in a cohort of UK pregnant women and to explore how it changes throughout gestation. DESIGN: We used samples and data from 230 UK pregnant women who were recruited to the Selenium in PRegnancy INTervention study. Iodine concentration was measured in spot-urine samples that were collected at \u223c12, 20, and 35 wk of gestation; creatinine concentration was also measured to correct for urine dilution. A linear mixed model was used to explore the effect of gestational week on iodine-to-creatinine ratio, with change in season, body mass index, daily milk intake, and maternal age controlled for. RESULTS: The median urinary iodine concentration from urine samples collected at all time points (n = 662) was 56.8 \u03bcg/L, and the iodine-to-creatinine ratio was 116 \u03bcg/g, thus classifying this cohort as mildly-to-moderately iodine deficient. The median iodine-to-creatinine ratios at 12, 20, and 35 wk were 102.5, 120.0, and 126.0 \u03bcg/g, respectively. Only 3% of women were taking iodine-containing prenatal supplements. The iodine-to-creatinine ratio increased with advancing gestation, and there was a significant interaction between gestational week and season (P = 0.026). For a 1-wk increase in gestation, the iodine-to-creatinine ratio increased by a factor of 1.05 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.08) in winter and by a factor of 1.04 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.08) in summer. CONCLUSIONS: This group of UK pregnant women was mildly-to-moderately iodine deficient at all trimesters, which is of public health concern. The finding that the iodine-to-creatinine ratio increased over the course of gestation may not be generalizable to populations with different iodine status from ours and merits further investigation.

A review of past and present research is presented with relevance to the therapeutic potential of bioactive molecules from abalone.", "25733633": "Metabolic response to epigallocatechin-3-gallate in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis: a randomized clinical trial.\nBACKGROUND: Muscle weakness and fatigue are common symptoms in multiple sclerosis (MS). Green tea catechins such as (-)epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) are known to improve energy metabolism at rest and during exercise. OBJECTIVE: We tested the hypothesis that EGCG improves energy metabolism and substrate utilization in patients with MS. DESIGN: Eighteen patients (8 men) with relapsing-remitting MS (expanded disability status scale score <4.5, all receiving glatiramer acetate) participated in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial at a clinical research center. All patients received EGCG (600 mg/d) and placebo over 12 wk (4-wk washout in between). After each intervention, fasting and postprandial energy expenditure (EE), as well as fat oxidation (FAOx) and carbohydrate oxidation (CHOx) rates, were measured either at rest or during 40 min of exercise (0.5 W/kg). At rest, blood samples and microdialysates from adipose tissue and skeletal muscle were also taken. RESULTS: At rest, postprandial EE and CHOx, as well as adipose tissue perfusion and glucose supply, were significantly lower in men but higher in women receiving EGCG compared with placebo. During exercise, postprandial EE was lower after EGCG than after placebo, indicating an increased working efficiency (men > women). After placebo, exercise EE was mainly fueled by FAOx in both men and women. After EGCG, there was a shift to a higher and more stable CHOx during exercise in men but not in women. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that EGCG given to patients with MS over 12 wk improves muscle metabolism during moderate exercise to a greater extent in men than in women, possibly because of sex-specific effects on autonomic and endocrine control.", "25853290": "Survival of Microencapsulated Probiotic Bacteria after Processing and during Storage: A Review.\nThe use of live probiotic bacteria as food supplement has become popular. Capability of probiotic bacteria to be kept at room temperature becomes necessary for customer's convenience and manufacturer's cost reduction. Hence, production of dried form of probiotic bacteria is important. Two common drying methods commonly used for microencapsulation are freeze drying and spray drying. In spite of their benefits, both methods have adverse effects on cell membrane integrity and protein structures resulting in decrease in bacterial viability. Microencapsulation of probiotic bacteria has been a promising technology to ensure bacterial stability during the drying process and to preserve their viability during storage without significantly losing their functional properties such acid tolerance, bile tolerance, surface hydrophobicity, and enzyme activities. Storage at room temperatures instead of freezing or low temperature storage is preferable for minimizing costs of handling, transportation, and storage. Concepts of water activity and glass transition become important in terms of determination of bacterial survival during the storage. The effectiveness of microencapsulation is also affected by microcapsule materials. Carbohydrate- and protein-based microencapsulants and their combination are discussed in terms of their protecting effect on probiotic bacteria during dehydration, during exposure to harsh gastrointestinal transit and small intestine transit and during storage.", "24915316": "Bacterial production of conjugated linoleic and linolenic Acid in foods: a technological challenge.\nConjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and conjugated linolenic acid (CLNA) isomers are present in foods derived from ruminants as a result of the respective linoleic acid (LA) and \u03b1-linolenic acid (LNA) metabolism by ruminal microorganisms and in animals' tissues. CLA and CLNA have isomer-specific, health-promoting properties, including anticarcinogenic, antiatherogenic, anti-inflammatory, and antidiabetic activity, as well as the ability to reduce body fat. Besides ruminal microorganisms, such as Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, many food-grade bacteria, such as bifidobacteria, lactic acid bacteria (LAB), and propionibacteria, are able to convert LA and LNA to CLA and CLNA, respectively. Linoleate isomerase activity, responsible for this conversion, is strain-dependent and probably related to the ability of the producer strain to tolerate the toxic effects of LA and LNA. Since natural concentrations of CLA and CLNA in ruminal food products are relatively low to exert their health benefits, food-grade bacteria with linoleate isomerase activity could be used as starter or adjunct cultures to develop functional fermented dairy and meat products with increased levels of CLA and CLNA or included in fermented products as probiotic cultures. However, results obtained so far are below expectations due to technological bottlenecks. More research is needed to assess if bacterial production kinetics can be increased and can match food processing requirements.", "26147443": "A Review: Supplementation of Foods with Essential Fatty Acids-Can It Turn a Breeze without Further Ado?\nThis paper focuses on the critical aspects of supplementation of foods with essential fatty acids (EFAs), the need, health benefits of supplementation and the constraints of the process.

During meat products processing, its functional values can be improved by supplementation of dietary fiber rich vegetative substances like cereal and pulse flour, vegetable and fruits pulp, etc. by this process, a significant proportion of required daily allowance of dietary fiber can be fulfilled for the frequent meat consumers. The consumption of meat products fortified with of dietary fiber can lead to the prevention of diseases like coronary heart disease, diabetes, irritable bowel disease, obesity, etc. On the other hand, the dietary fiber can effectively be incorporated in the processed meat products as binders, extender, and filler, they can significantly replace the unhealthy fat components from the products; increase acceptability by improving nutritional components, pH, water-holding capacity, emulsion stability, shear press value, sensory characters, etc. of finished products.

However, excess iron can cause tissue damage through its pro-oxidative effects, potentiating the development of many diseases such as cancer through the generation of reactive oxidative species. The two major forms of iron in the diet are heme and nonheme iron, both of which are found in several different foods. In addition to natural food sources, intake of nonheme iron may also come from fortified foods or in supplement form. This review summarizes the results of human population studies that have examined the role of dietary iron (heme and nonheme), heme iron alone, and iron from supplements in colorectal carcinogenesis.", "24987868": "Methods of Selenium Supplementation: Bioavailability and Determination of Selenium Compounds.\nSelenium, a \"dual-surface\" element, maintains a very thin line between a level of necessity and harmfulness. Because of this, a deficiency or excess of this element in an organism is dangerous and causes health-related problems, both physically and mentally. The main source of selenium is a balanced diet, with a proper selection of meat and plant products. Meanwhile, the proper assimilation of selenium into these products depends on their bioavailability, bioaccessibility, and/or bioactivity of a given selenium compound. From the time when it was discovered that selenium and its compounds have a significant influence on metabolic processes and in many countries throughout the world, a low quantity of selenium was found in different parts of the environment, pressure was put upon an effective and fast method of supplementing the environment with the help of selenium. This work describes supplementation methods applied with the use of selenium, as well as new ideas for increasing the level of this element in various organisms. Based on the fact that selenium appears in the environment at trace levels, the determination of total amount of selenium or selenium speciation in a given sample demands the selection of appropriate measurement methods. These methods are most often comprised of a sample preparation technique and/or a separation technique as well as a detection system. The work presents information on the subject of analytical methods used for determining selenium and its compounds as well as examples in literature of their application.", "25332321": "Fish-oil supplementation alters numbers of circulating endothelial progenitor cells and microparticles independently of eNOS genotype.\nBACKGROUND: Emerging cellular markers of endothelial damage and repair include endothelial microparticles (EMPs) and endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), respectively. Effects of long-chain (LC) n-3 (omega-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and the influence of genetic background on these markers are not known. OBJECTIVE: We investigated effects of fish-oil supplementation on both classical and novel markers of endothelial function in subjects prospectively genotyped for the Asp298 endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) polymorphism and at moderate risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). DESIGN: A total of 84 subjects with moderate risk of CVD (GG: n = 40; GT/TT: n = 44) completed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 8-wk crossover trial of fish-oil supplementation that provided 1.5 g LC n-3 PUFAs/d. Effects of genotype and fish-oil supplementation on the blood lipid profile, inflammatory markers, vascular function (by using peripheral artery tonometry), and numbers of circulating EPCs and EMPs (by using flow cytometry) were assessed. RESULTS: There was no significant effect of fish-oil supplementation on blood pressure, plasma lipids, or plasma glucose, although there was a trend (P = 0.069) toward a decrease in the plasma triglyceride concentration after fish-oil supplementation compared with placebo treatment. GT/TT subjects tended to have higher concentrations of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, but vascular function was not affected by either treatment or eNOS genotype. Biochemical markers of endothelial function were also unaffected by treatment and eNOS genotype. In contrast, there was a significant effect of fish-oil supplementation on cellular markers of endothelial function. Fish-oil supplementation increased numbers of EPCs and reduced numbers of EMPs relative to those with placebo treatment, which potentially favored the maintenance of endothelial integrity. There was no influence of genotype for any cellular markers of endothelial function, which indicated that effects of fish-oil supplementation were independent of eNOS genotype. CONCLUSION: Emerging cellular markers of endothelial damage, integrity, and repair appear to be sensitive to potentially beneficial modification by dietary n-3 PUFAs.

Lactose intolerance symptoms vary depending on the residual lactase activity, the small bowel transit time, and especially the amount of ingested lactose. To formulate dairy products suitable for the vast majority of lactose intolerants, it is essential to define lactose intolerance threshold. A recent meta-analysis permitted to show that almost all lactose intolerants tolerate 12\u00a0g of lactose in one intake and approximately 18\u00a0g of lactose spread over the day. The prevalence and severity of lactose intolerance are probably overestimated by the general public. This misconception usually leads to an unnecessary reduction of dairy foodstuff consumption. Nevertheless, dairy products are essential for health mainly due to their calcium content and the positive influence of probiotic bacteria. The formulation of dairy products suitable for most intolerant and suspicious subjects seems necessary. The use of exogenous enzyme preparations, as well as the consumption of lactose-free products or products rich in probiotic bacteria are proposed as symptom-reducing strategies.", "26354537": "Carotenoids, vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E, and folate and risk of self-reported hearing loss in women.\nBACKGROUND: Higher intake of certain vitamins may protect against cochlear damage from vascular compromise and oxidative stress, thereby reducing risk of acquired hearing loss, but data are limited. OBJECTIVE: We prospectively examined the relation between carotenoids, vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E, and folate intake and risk of self-reported hearing loss in women. DESIGN: This prospective cohort study followed 65,521 women in the Nurses' Health Study II from 1991 to 2009. Baseline and updated information obtained from validated biennial questionnaires was used in Cox proportional hazards regression models to examine independent associations between nutrient intake and self-reported hearing loss. RESULTS: After 1,084,598 person-years of follow-up, 12,789 cases of incident hearing loss were reported. After multivariable adjustment, we observed modest but statistically significant inverse associations between higher intake of \u03b2-carotene and \u03b2-cryptoxanthin and risk of hearing loss. In comparison with women in the lowest quintile of intake, the multivariable-adjusted RR of hearing loss among women in the highest quintile was 0.88 (95% CI: 0.81, 0.94; P-trend < 0.001) for \u03b2-carotene and 0.90 (95% CI: 0.84, 0.96; P-trend < 0.001) for \u03b2-cryptoxanthin. In comparison with women with folate intake 200-399 \u03bcg/d, very low folate intake (<200 \u03bcg/d) was associated with higher risk (RR: 1.19; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.41), and higher intake tended to be associated with lower risk (P-trend = 0.04). No significant associations were observed for intakes of other carotenoids or vitamin A. Higher vitamin C intake was associated with higher risk; in comparison with women with intake <75 mg/d, the RR among women with vitamin C intake \u22651000 mg/d (mainly supplemental) was 1.22 (95% CI: 1.06, 1.42; P-trend = 0.02). There was no significant trend between intake of vitamin E intake and risk. CONCLUSION: Higher intakes of \u03b2-carotene, \u03b2-cryptoxanthin, and folate, whether total or from diet, are associated with lower risk of hearing loss, whereas higher vitamin C intake is associated with higher risk.", "25527761": "Calcium and phosphorus intake and prostate cancer risk: a 24-y follow-up study.\nBACKGROUND: High calcium intake has been associated with an increased risk of advanced-stage and high-grade prostate cancer. Several studies have found a positive association between phosphorus intake and prostate cancer risk. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the joint association between calcium and phosphorus and risk of prostate cancer in the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, with a focus on lethal and high-grade disease. DESIGN: In total, 47,885 men in the cohort reported diet data in 1986 and every 4 y thereafter. From 1986 to 2010, 5861 cases of prostate cancer were identified, including 789 lethal cancers (fatal or metastatic). We used Cox proportional hazards models to assess the association between calcium and phosphorus intake and prostate cancer, with adjustment for potential confounding. RESULTS: Calcium intakes >2000 mg/d were associated with greater risk of total prostate cancer and lethal and high-grade cancers. These associations were attenuated and no longer statistically significant when phosphorus intake was adjusted for. Phosphorus intake was associated with greater risk of total, lethal, and high-grade cancers, independent of calcium and intakes of red meat, white meat, dairy, and fish. In latency analysis, calcium and phosphorus had independent effects for different time periods between exposure and diagnosis. Calcium intake was associated with an increased risk of advanced-stage and high-grade disease 12-16 y after exposure, whereas high phosphorus was associated with increased risk of advanced-stage and high-grade disease 0-8 y after exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Phosphorus is independently associated with risk of lethal and high-grade prostate cancer. Calcium may not have a strong independent effect on prostate cancer risk except with long latency periods.", "25830657": "Structural Characterization, Technological Functionality, and Physiological Aspects of Fungal \u03b2-D-glucans: A Review.\n\u03b2-D-glucans are a (1\u21923)-linked glucose polymer with (1\u21926)-linked side chains and a major component of fungal cell walls. They exhibit structural integrity to the fungal cell wall. In addition, \u03b2-glucans are widely used as food adjuvant in food and pharmaceutical industries because of their physico-chemical properties. Several studies have focused on different isolation processes of (1\u21923) (1\u21926)-\u03b2-glucan that could affect the physico-chemical and functional properties of \u03b2-glucan such as chemical composition, solubility, viscosity, hydration properties, and oil binding capacity. Immunological activity is one of the most important properties of \u03b2-glucans. Thus, they are effective in inhibiting growth of cancer cells and metastasis and preventing bacterial infection. In humans, \u03b2-glucans reduce blood cholesterol, improve glucose absorption by body cells, and so help wound healing.

What are the adverse consequences of inadequate dietary \u03b1-tocopherol intakes? This review discusses health aspects where inadequate vitamin E status is detrimental and additional vitamin E has reversed the symptoms. In general, plasma \u03b1-tocopherol concentrations <12 \u03bcmol/L are associated with increased infection, anemia, stunting of growth, and poor outcomes during pregnancy for both the infant and the mother. When low dietary amounts of \u03b1-tocopherol are consumed, tissue \u03b1-tocopherol needs exceed amounts available, leading to increased damage to target tissues. Seemingly, adequacy of human vitamin E status cannot be assessed from circulating \u03b1-tocopherol concentrations, but inadequacy can be determined from \u201clow\u201d values. Circulating \u03b1-tocopherol concentrations are very difficult to interpret because, as a person ages, plasma lipid concentrations also increase and these elevations in lipids increase the plasma carriers for \u03b1-tocopherol, leading to higher circulating \u03b1-tocopherol concentrations. However, abnormal lipoprotein metabolism does not necessarily increase \u03b1-tocopherol delivery to tissues. Additional biomarkers of inadequate vitamin E status are needed. Urinary excretion of the vitamin E metabolite \u03b1-carboxy-ethyl-hydroxychromanol may fulfill this biomarker role, but it has not been widely studied with regard to vitamin E status in humans or with regard to health benefits. This review evaluated the information available on the adverse consequences of inadequate \u03b1-tocopherol status and provides suggestions for avenues for research.", "25848935": "Probiotics, prebiotics, and microencapsulation: A review.\nThe development of a suitable technology for the production of probiotics is a key research for industrial production, which should take into account the viability and the stability of the organisms involved.

Generally, the bacteria belonging to the genera Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium have been used as probiotics. Based on their positive qualities, probiotic bacteria are widely used in the production of food. Interest in the incorporation of the probiotic bacteria into other products apart from dairy products has been increasing and represents a great challenge. The recognition of dose delivery systems for probiotic bacteria has also resulted in research efforts aimed at developing probiotic food outside the dairy sector.

OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether higher first-trimester concentrations of \u03b1-tocopherol and \u03b3-tocopherol were associated with reduced odds of miscarriage (pregnancy losses <24 wk of gestation) in women in rural Bangladesh. DESIGN: A case-cohort study in 1605 pregnant Bangladeshi women [median (IQR) gestational age: 10 wk (8-13 wk)] who participated in a placebo-controlled vitamin A- or \u03b2-carotene-supplementation trial was done to assess ORs of miscarriage in women with low \u03b1-tocopherol (<12.0 \u03bcmol/L) and \u03b3-tocopherol (<0.81 \u03bcmol/L; upper tertile cutoff of the \u03b3-tocopherol distribution in women who did not miscarry). RESULTS: In all women, plasma \u03b1- and \u03b3-tocopherol concentrations were low [median (IQR): 10.04 \u03bcmol/L (8.07-12.35 \u03bcmol/L) and 0.66 \u03bcmol/L (0.50-0.95 \u03bcmol/L), respectively]. In a logistic regression analysis that was adjusted for cholesterol and the other tocopherol, low \u03b1-tocopherol was associated with an OR of 1.83 (95% CI: 1.04, 3.20), whereas a low \u03b3-tocopherol concentration was associated with an OR of 0.62 (95% CI: 0.41, 0.93) for miscarriage. Subgroup analyses revealed that opposing ORs were evident only in women with BMI (in kg/m(2)) \u226518.5 and serum ferritin concentration \u2264150 \u03bcg/L, although low BMI and elevated ferritin conferred stronger risk of miscarriage. CONCLUSIONS: In pregnant women in rural Bangladesh, low plasma \u03b1-tocopherol was associated with increased risk of miscarriage, and low \u03b3-tocopherol was associated with decreased risk of miscarriage.

These products have been marketed and sold as beverages (conventional foods), energy shots (dietary supplements), and in pill or tablet form. Recently, the number of available products has surged, and formulations have changed to include caffeine. To help characterize the use of caffeine-containing energy products in the United States, three sources of data were analyzed: sales data, data from federal sources, and reports from the Drug Abuse Warning Network. These data indicate that sales of caffeine-containing energy products and emergency room visits involving their consumption appear to be increasing over time. Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2007-2010 indicate that 2.7% [standard error (SE) 0.2%] of the US population \u22651 year of age used a caffeine-containing energy product, providing approximately 150-200\u2009mg/day of caffeine per day in addition to caffeine from traditional sources like coffee, tea, and colas. The highest usage of these products was among males between the ages of 19 and 30 years (7.6%, SE 1.0).

In order to investigate the potential benefit of Camellia Sinenis products in asymptomatic hyperuricemia, a meta-analysis of long-term Randomized Controlled Trials (RCT) with tea or tea extract has been conducted. From 20 human intervention studies selected only 5 RCT (13 interventions) were suitable for meta-analysis (n = 472). The current \"normal\" range set for hyperuricemia fails to identify patients with potential metabolic disorders. Therefore on the basis of the literature data, we fixed cut-off limits for UA baseline levels of 4.5\u00a0mg/dl for women, 6.1\u00a0mg/dl for men, and 5.5\u00a0mg/dl for studies involving mixed populations. Statistically significant effects were not found, but subgroup analysis revealed that the Pooled Estimate effect was different in subjects with baseline levels under [MD (95% CI): 0.1078 (-0.0528 to 0.2684)] and over the cut-off [MD (95% CI): -0.0239 (0.3311 to 0.2833)].

To our knowledge, there have been no comprehensive studies on the role of micronutrient supplementation in children with tuberculosis. OBJECTIVE: We assessed the effect of micronutrient supplementation in children treated with antituberculosis therapy (ATT). DESIGN: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that used a 2 \u00d7 2 factorial design was undertaken at 2 teaching hospitals in Delhi. Children with newly diagnosed intrathoracic tuberculosis were enrolled, and they received ATT together with daily supplementation for 6 mo with either zinc alone, micronutrients without zinc, micronutrients in combination with zinc, or a placebo. Main outcomes were weight gain and an improvement in a chest X-ray (CXR) lesion assessed at 6 mo of treatment. RESULTS: A total of 403 children were enrolled and randomly assigned. A microbiological diagnosis of tuberculosis was confirmed in 179 children (44.4%). The median (95% CI) increase in weight-for-age z score at 6 mo was not significantly different between subjects who received micronutrients [0.75 (0.66, 0.84)] and those who did not receive micronutrients [0.76 (0.67, 0.85)] and between subjects who received zinc [0.76 (0.68, 0.85)] and those who did not receive zinc [0.75 (0.66, 0.83)]. An improvement in CXR was observed in 285 children, but there was no difference between those receiving zinc and no zinc or between those receiving micronutrients and no micronutrients after 6 mo of ATT. However, children who received micronutrients had a faster gain in height over 6 mo than did those who did not receive micronutrients (height-for-age z score \u0394 = 0.08; P = 0.014). CONCLUSIONS: Micronutrient supplementation did not modify the weight gain or clearance of lesions on CXR in children with intrathoracic tuberculosis. However, micronutrient supplementation during treatment may improve height gain in children with intrathoracic tuberculosis.

OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether dietary supplementation with whey protein and medium-chain saturated fatty acids (MC-SFAs) improved postprandial lipid metabolism in humans with abdominal obesity. DESIGN: We conducted a 12-wk, randomized, double-blinded, diet intervention study. Sixty-three adults were randomly allocated to one of 4 diets in a 2 \u00d7 2 factorial design. Participants consumed 60 g milk protein (whey or casein) and 63 g milk fat (with high or low MC-SFA content) daily. Before and after the intervention, a high-fat meal test was performed. We measured changes from baseline in fasting and postprandial triacylglycerol, apolipoprotein B-48 (apoB-48; reflecting chylomicrons of intestinal origin), free fatty acids (FFAs), insulin, glucose, glucagon, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), and gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP). Furthermore, changes in the expression of adipose tissue genes involved in lipid metabolism were investigated. Two-factor ANOVA was used to examine the difference between protein types and fatty acid compositions, as well as any interaction between the two. RESULTS: Fifty-two participants completed the study. We found that the postprandial apoB-48 response decreased significantly after whey compared with casein (P = 0.025) independently of fatty acid composition. Furthermore, supplementation with casein resulted in a significant increase in the postprandial GLP-1 response compared with whey (P = 0.003). We found no difference in postprandial triacylglycerol, FFA, insulin, glucose, glucagon, or GIP related to protein type or MC-SFA content. We observed no interaction between milk protein and milk fat on postprandial lipemia. CONCLUSION: We found that a whey protein supplement decreased the postprandial chylomicron response compared with casein in persons with abdominal obesity, thereby indicating a beneficial impact on CVD risk.

Thus far, a variety of probiotic products have been developed which can be categorized into two groups: probiotic foods and supplements. Both foods and supplements have been able to confer the health benefits claimed for them. However, it is not known which one can be clinically more efficient, and to the best of our knowledge, until now no research has been conducted to investigate this issue. The present review aims to discuss this matter, based on the evidence available in the literature. To do so, articles indexed in PubMed and ScienceDirect between 2000 and 2011 were reviewed. The articles included the clinical trials in which either foods or supplements were used to administer the probiotics to either patients suffering from different diseases or healthy subjects. Although both foods and supplements seem to have been efficient carriers for the beneficial bacteria, to generally promote public health in communities, probiotic foods appear to be preferred to probiotic supplements.", "26468123": "Selenium deficiency occurs in some patients with moderate-to-severe cirrhosis and can be corrected by administration of selenate but not selenomethionine: a randomized controlled trial.\nBACKGROUND: Selenomethionine, which is the principal dietary form of selenium, is metabolized by the liver to selenide, which is the form of the element required for the synthesis of selenoproteins. The liver synthesizes selenium-rich selenoprotein P (SEPP1) and secretes it into the plasma to supply extrahepatic tissues with selenium. OBJECTIVES: We conducted a randomized controlled trial to determine whether cirrhosis is associated with functional selenium deficiency (the lack of selenium for the process of selenoprotein synthesis even though selenium intake is not limited) and, if it is, whether the deficiency is associated with impairment of selenomethionine metabolism. DESIGN: Patients with Child-Pugh (C-P) classes A, B, and C (mild, moderate, and severe, respectively) cirrhosis were supplemented with a placebo or supranutritional amounts of selenium as selenate (200 or 400 \u03bcg/d) or as selenomethionine (200 \u03bcg/d) for 4 wk. Plasma SEPP1 concentration and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activity, the latter due largely to the selenoprotein GPX3 secreted by the kidneys, were measured before and after supplementation. RESULTS: GPX activity was increased more by both doses of selenate than by the placebo in C-P class B patients. The activity was not increased more by selenomethionine supplementation than by the placebo in C-P class B patients. Plasma selenium was increased more by 400 \u03bcg Se as selenate than by the placebo in C-P class C patients. Within the groups who responded to selenate, there was a considerable variation in responses. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that severe cirrhosis causes mild functional selenium deficiency in some patients that is associated with impaired metabolism of selenomethionine.

OBJECTIVE: The aim was to examine the relative impact of voluntary fortification and supplement use on dietary intakes and biomarker status of folate and vitamin B-12 in Irish adults. DESIGN: Folic acid and vitamin B-12 from fortified foods and supplements were estimated by using brand information for participants from the cross-sectional National Adult Nutrition Survey 2008-2010. Dietary and biomarker values were compared between 6 mutually exclusive consumption groups formed on the basis of folic acid intake. RESULTS: The consumption of folic acid through fortified foods at low, medium, and high levels of exposure [median (IQR) intakes of 22 (13, 32), 69 (56, 84), and 180 (137, 248) \u03bcg/d, respectively]; from supplements [203 (150, 400) \u03bcg/d]; or from both sources [287 (220, 438) \u03bcg/d] was associated with significantly higher folate intakes and status compared with nonconsumption of folic acid (18% of the population). Median (IQR) red blood cell (RBC) folate increased significantly from 699 (538, 934) nmol/L in nonconsumers to 1040 (83, 1390) nmol/L in consumers with a high intake of fortified foods (P < 0.001), with further nonsignificant increases in supplement users. Supplement use but not fortification was associated with significantly higher serum vitamin B-12 concentrations relative to nonconsumers (P < 0.001). Two-thirds of young women had suboptimal RBC folate for protection against neural tube defects (NTDs); among nonconsumers of folic acid, only 16% attained optimal RBC folate. CONCLUSIONS: The consumption of voluntarily fortified foods and/or supplement use was associated with significantly higher dietary intakes and biomarker status of folate in Irish adults. Of concern, the majority of young women remain suboptimally protected against NTDs.", "26085515": "Interaction between BMI and APOE genotype is associated with changes in the plasma long-chain-PUFA response to a fish-oil supplement in healthy participants.\nBACKGROUND: Carriers of the apolipoprotein E \u025b4 (APOE4) allele are lower responders to a docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) supplement than are noncarriers. This effect could be exacerbated in overweight individuals because DHA metabolism changes according to body mass index (BMI; in kg/m\u00b2). OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the plasma fatty acid (FA) response to a DHA-rich supplement in APOE4 carriers and noncarriers consuming a high-saturated fat diet (HSF diet) and, in addition, evaluated whether being overweight changed this response. DESIGN: This study was part of the SATgen\u025b trial. Forty-one APOE4 carriers and 41 noncarriers were prospectively recruited and consumed an HSF diet for 8-wk followed by 8 wk of consumption of an HSF diet with the addition of DHA and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (HSF + DHA diet; 3.45 g DHA/d and 0.5 g EPA/d). Fasting plasma samples were collected at the end of each intervention diet. Plasma total lipids (TLs) were separated into free FAs, neutral lipids (NLs), and phospholipids by using solid-phase extraction, and FA profiles in each lipid class were quantified by using gas chromatography. RESULTS: Because the plasma FA response to the HSF + DHA diet was correlated with BMI in APOE4 carriers but not in noncarriers, the following 2 groups were formed according to the BMI median: low BMI (<25.5) and high BMI (\u226525.5). In response to the HSF + DHA diet, there were significant BMI \u00d7 genotype interactions for changes in plasma concentrations of arachidonic acid and DHA in phospholipids and TLs and of EPA in NLs and TLs (P \u2264 0.05). APOE4 carriers were lower plasma responders to the DHA supplement than were noncarriers but only in the high-BMI group. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that apolipoprotein E genotype and BMI may be important variables that determine the plasma long-chain PUFA response to dietary fat manipulation. APOE4 carriers with BMI \u226525.5 may need higher intakes of DHA for cardiovascular or other health benefits than do noncarriers.", "24898234": "Plant compared with marine n-3 fatty acid effects on cardiovascular risk factors and outcomes: what is the verdict?\nPlants provide \u03b1-linolenic acid [ALA; 18:3n-3 (18:3\u03c9-3)], which can be converted via eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5n-3) to docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n-3), which is required for normal visual and cognitive function. Dietary ALA is provided mainly by vegetable oils, especially soybean and rapeseed oils, but is destroyed by partial hydrogenation; it is also present in high amounts in walnuts and flaxseed. Dietary EPA and DHA are provided mainly by fish and so are absent from vegan diets and only present in trace amounts in vegetarian diets. Vegetarians and vegans have lower proportions of DHA in blood and tissue lipids compared with omnivores. High intakes of EPA and DHA (typically in the range of 3-5 g/d) but not ALA have favorable effects on several cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and have been postulated to delay arterial aging and cardiovascular mortality, but these intakes are beyond the range of normal dietary intake. Arterial stiffness, which is a measure of arterial aging, appears to be lower in vegans than in omnivores; and risk of CVD in vegetarians and vegans is approximately one-third that in omnivores. Prospective cohort studies showed higher intakes of EPA+DHA, and less consistently ALA, to be associated with a lower risk of CVD, especially fatal coronary heart disease, but meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials of supplementation of EPA+DHA or ALA in secondary prevention of CVD showed no clear benefit. Current evidence is insufficient to warrant advising vegans and vegetarians to supplement their diets with EPA or DHA for CVD prevention.", "24903007": "Prebiotics in healthy infants and children for prevention of acute infectious diseases: a systematic review and meta-analysis.\nPrebiotics, defined as nondigestible dietary ingredients resistant to gastric acidity and fermented by the intestinal flora, are used to positively influence the composition of intestinal flora, thereby promoting health benefits. The objective of this systematic review was to assess the efficacy of prebiotics in the prevention of acute infectious diseases in children. A systematic literature search was conducted using the Ovid Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library's Central databases. Finally, five randomized controlled trials, all of them investigating infants and children 0-24 months of age, were included in the review. Pooled estimates from three studies revealed a statistically significant decrease in the number of infectious episodes requiring antibiotic therapy in the prebiotic group as compared with the placebo group (rate ratio 0.68; 95% confidence interval 0.61-0.77). Studies available indicate that prebiotics may also be effective in decreasing the rate of overall infections in infants and children 0-24 months of age. Further studies in the age group 3-18 years are required to determine whether prebiotics can be considered for the prevention of acute infectious diseases in the older pediatric population.", "24646817": "Dietary vitamin intake correlates with hearing thresholds in the older population: the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.\nBACKGROUND: Previous animal studies have shown that vitamins may prevent age-related hearing loss. However, no concrete conclusions have been reached about the association between vitamin intake and presbycusis in humans. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the association between dietary vitamin intake and hearing thresholds in adults between 50 and 80 y of age by using data from a large population-based survey. DESIGN: We used data from the 2011 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. A pure-tone audiogram and physical examination of the ear were performed, and vitamin intake was calculated by using the 24-h recall method. Data from 1910 participants were analyzed through univariate and multivariate linear regression analyses. RESULTS: After adjustment for age, sex, smoking, and exposure to occupational and explosive noise, intake of vitamin C correlated with better hearing at midfrequency (2000 and 3000 Hz) (coefficient: -0.012; 95% CI: -0.022, -0.002). Dietary supplement use was positively associated with better hearing at all frequencies. The univariate analysis indicated that dietary intakes of retinol, riboflavin, niacin, and vitamin C were positively correlated with better hearing at most frequencies. In contrast, serum concentrations of vitamin D were associated with worse hearing at mid and high (4000 and 6000 Hz) frequencies. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary intake of vitamin C was associated with better hearing in the older population. Because less than one-half of elderly participants in this study consumed a sufficient amount of vitamins, and vitamin intake decreased with age, we should consider proper diet counseling to prevent hearing decline.", "25162145": "Prebiotics: A Potential Treatment Strategy for the Chemotherapy-damaged Gut?\nMucositis, characterized by ulcerative lesions along the alimentary tract, is a common consequence of many chemotherapy regimens. Chemotherapy negatively disrupts the intestinal microbiota, resulting in increased numbers of potentially pathogenic bacteria, such as Clostridia and Enterobacteriaceae, and decreased numbers of \"beneficial\" bacteria, such as Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria. Agents capable of restoring homeostasis in the bowel microbiota could, therefore, be applicable to mucositis. Prebiotics are indigestible compounds, commonly oligosaccharides, that seek to reverse chemotherapy-induced intestinal dysbiosis through selective colonization of the intestinal microbiota by probiotic bacteria. In addition, evidence is emerging that certain prebiotics contribute to nutrient digestibility and absorption, modulate intestinal barrier function through effects on mucin expression, and also modify mucosal immune responses, possibly via inflammasome-mediated processes. This review examines the known mechanisms of prebiotic action, and explores their potential for reducing the severity of chemotherapy-induced mucositis in the intestine.", "26567201": "Vitamins in pancreatic cancer: a review of underlying mechanisms and future applications.\nAlthough there is increasing evidence that vitamins influence pancreatic adenocarcinoma biology and carcinogenesis, a comprehensive review is lacking. In this study, we performed a PubMed literature search to review the anticancer mechanisms and the preclinical and clinical studies that support the development of the bioactive vitamins A, C, D, E, and K in pancreatic cancer intervention. Preclinical studies have shown promising results for vitamin A in pancreatic cancer prevention, with clinical trials showing intriguing responses in combination with immunotherapy. For vitamin C, preclinical studies have shown slower tumor growth rates and/or increased survival when used alone or in combination with gemcitabine, with clinical trials with this combination revealing decreased primary tumor sizes and improved performance status. Preclinical studies with vitamin D analogues have shown potent antiproliferative effects and repression of migration and invasion of pancreatic cancer cells, with a clinical trial showing increased time to progression when calciferol was added to docetaxel. For vitamin E, preclinical studies have shown that \u03b4-tocotrienol and \u03b3-tocotrienol inhibited tumor cell growth and survival and augmented gemcitabine activity. Early-phase clinical trials with \u03b4-tocotrienol are ongoing. Vitamin K demonstrates activation of apoptosis and inhibition of cellular growth in pancreatic tumor cells; however, there are no clinical studies available for further evaluation. Although preclinical and clinical studies are encouraging, randomized controlled trials with endpoints based on insights gained from mechanistic and preclinical studies and early-phase clinical trials are required to determine the efficacy of bioactive vitamin interventions in pancreatic cancer.", "25332325": "Isoflavone supplement composition and equol producer status affect gene expression in adipose tissue: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial in postmenopausal women.\nBACKGROUND: Isoflavone supplements, consumed by women experiencing menopausal symptoms, are suggested to have positive effects on menopause-related adiposity and cardiovascular disease risk profile, but discussions about their safety are still ongoing. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to study the effects of an 8-wk consumption of 2 different isoflavone supplements compared with placebo on whole-genome gene expression in the adipose tissue of postmenopausal women. DESIGN: This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover intervention consisted of 2 substudies, one with a low-genistein (LG) supplement (56% daidzein + daidzin, 16% genistein + genistin, and 28% glycitein + glycitin) and the other with a high-genistein (HG) supplement (49% daidzein + daidzin, 41% genistein + genistin, and 10% glycitein + glycitin). Both supplements provided \u223c 100 mg isoflavones/d (aglycone equivalents). After the 8-wk isoflavone and placebo period, whole-genome arrays were performed in subcutaneous adipose tissue of postmenopausal women (n = 26 after LG, n = 31 after HG). Participants were randomized by equol-producing phenotype, and data analysis was performed per substudy for equol producers and nonproducers separately. RESULTS: Gene set enrichment analysis showed downregulation of expression of energy metabolism-related genes after LG supplementation (n = 24) in both equol-producing phenotypes and oppositely regulated expression for equol producers (down) and nonproducers (up) after HG supplementation (n = 31). Expression of inflammation-related genes was upregulated in equol producers but downregulated in nonproducers, independent of supplement type. Only 4.4-7.0% of the genes with significantly changed expression were estrogen responsive. Body weight, adipocyte size, and plasma lipid profile were not affected by isoflavone supplementation. CONCLUSIONS: Effects of isoflavones on adipose tissue gene expression were influenced by supplement composition and equol-producing phenotype, whereas estrogen-responsive effects were lacking. LG isoflavone supplementation resulted in a caloric restriction-like gene expression profile for both producer phenotypes and pointed toward a potential beneficial effect, whereas both supplements induced anti-inflammatory gene expression in equol producers.

Irrespective of the abundance of bioactive components in different fruits and vegetables, their low solubility in aqueous solution, vulnerability to destruction in different environmental and gastrointestinal conditions and a low intestinal absorption becomes a concern. Because it is quite difficult to commercialize non food materials for the food encapsulation purposes due to their safety concerns in the human body, scientists in the recent times have come up with the idea of encapsulating the different bioactive components in different food grade materials that are able to safeguard these bioactive components against the different environmental and gastrointestinal conditions and ensure their safe and targeted delivery at their absorption sites. Different food grade encapsulation materials including various oligosaccharides, polysaccharides (starch, cyclodextrins, alginates, chitosan, gum arabic, and carboxymethyl cellulose) and proteins and their suitability for encapsulating various bioactive components like flavonoids (catechins, rutin, curcumin, hesperetin, and vanillin), nonflavonoids (resveratrol), carotenoids (\u03b2-carotene, lycopene, and lutein), and fatty acids (fish oil, flaxseed oil, and olive oil) of high medical and nutritional value are reviewed here.", "25879917": "Adhesion of Lactobacilli and their anti-infectivity potential.\nThe probiotic potential of lactic acid bacteria primarily point toward colonizing ability of Lactobacilli as the most important attribute for endowing all the known beneficial effects in a host.

OBJECTIVE: The objective was to examine the effect of a high whey protein-, leucine-, and vitamin D-enriched supplement on muscle mass preservation during intentional weight loss in obese older adults. DESIGN: We included 80 obese older adults in a double-blind randomized controlled trial. During a 13-wk weight loss program, all subjects followed a hypocaloric diet (-600 kcal/d) and performed resistance training 3\u00d7/wk. Subjects were randomly allocated to a high whey protein-, leucine-, and vitamin D-enriched supplement including a mix of other macro- and micronutrients (150 kcal, 21 g protein; 10\u00d7/wk, intervention group) or an isocaloric control. The primary outcome was change in appendicular muscle mass. The secondary outcomes were body composition, handgrip strength, and physical performance. Data were analyzed by using ANCOVA and mixed linear models with sex and baseline value as covariates. RESULTS: At baseline, mean \u00b1 SD age was 63 \u00b1 5.6 y, and body mass index (in kg/m(2)) was 33 \u00b1 4.4. During the trial, protein intake was 1.11 \u00b1 0.28 g \u00b7 kg body weight(-1) \u00b7 d(-1) in the intervention group compared with 0.85 \u00b1 0.24 g \u00b7 kg body weight(-1) \u00b7 d(-1) in the control group (P < 0.001). Both intervention and control groups decreased in body weight (-3.4 \u00b1 3.6 kg and -2.8 \u00b1 2.8 kg; both P < 0.001) and fat mass (-3.2 \u00b1 3.1 kg and -2.5 \u00b1 2.4 kg; both P < 0.001), with no differences between groups. The 13-wk change in appendicular muscle mass, however, was different in the intervention and control groups [+0.4 \u00b1 1.2 kg and -0.5 \u00b1 2.1 kg, respectively; \u03b2 = 0.95 kg (95% CI: 0.09, 1.81); P = 0.03].

We developed a small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplement (SQ-LNS) to enrich the diets of pregnant women. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to test a hypothesis that home fortification of pregnant women's diets with SQ-LNS would increase birth size in an African community. DESIGN: We enrolled 1391 women with uncomplicated pregnancies (<20 gestational weeks) in a randomized controlled trial in Malawi. The women were provided with one daily iron-folic acid (IFA) capsule, one capsule containing multiple micronutrients (MMNs), or one 20-g sachet of SQ-LNS (LNS, containing 118 kcal, protein, carbohydrates, essential fatty acids, and 21 micronutrients). Primary outcomes were birth weight and newborn length. Secondary outcomes included newborn weight, head and arm circumference, and pregnancy duration. Analysis was by intention to treat. RESULTS: The mean \u00b1 SD birth weight and newborn length were 2948 \u00b1 432, 2964 \u00b1 460, and 3000 \u00b1 447 g (P = 0.258) and 49.5 \u00b1 2.4, 49.7 \u00b1 2.2, and 49.9 \u00b1 2.1 cm (P = 0.104) in the IFA, MMN, and LNS groups, respectively. For newborn weight-for-age, head circumference, and arm circumference, the point estimate for the mean was also highest in the LNS group, intermediate in the MMN group, and lowest in the IFA group, but except for midupper arm circumference (P = 0.024), the differences were not statistically significant. The prevalence of low birth weight (<2500 g) was 12.7%, 13.5%, and 12.1% (P = 0.856), respectively; newborn stunting (length-for-age z score < -2) was 19.2%, 14.0%, and 14.9% (P = 0.130), respectively; and newborn small head circumference (head circumference-for-age z score < -2) was 5.8%, 3.0%, and 3.1% (P = 0.099), respectively.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess whether vitamin D and calcium supplements cause changes in adiposity. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases were searched for literature published from 1966 to March 2014. STUDY SELECTION: A systematic search was conducted for randomized clinical trials with \u2265 50 participants aged \u2265 18 years at baseline who had received at least 12 weeks of treatment. Among the inclusion criteria were supplementation with vitamin D with or without calcium and measurement of adiposity (weight, body mass index [BMI], and/or fat mass).

OBJECTIVE: The objective was to investigate how multivitamin use is associated with the long- and short-term risk of CVD. DESIGN: A prospective cohort study was conducted of 37,193 women from the Women's Health Study aged \u226545 y and free of CVD and cancer at baseline who were followed for an average of 16.2 y. At baseline, women self-reported a wide range of lifestyle, clinical, and dietary factors. Women were categorized into 1) no current use and 2) current use of multivitamins. Duration and updated measures over the course of the follow-up to address short-term effects were also considered. Women were followed for major CVD events, including myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and CVD death. RESULTS: During the follow-up, 1493 incident cases of CVD [defined as myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and CVD death] occurred. In multivariable analyses, multivitamin use compared with no use was not associated with major CVD events (HR: 1.01; 95% CI: 0.89, 1.15), MI (HR: 1.04; 95% CI: 0.84, 1.27), stroke (HR: 0.99; 95% CI: 0.83, 1.18), or CVD death (HR: 1.10; 95% CI: 0.84, 1.45).

OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to investigate the association between postmenopausal breast cancer risk and current or past vitamin D supplementation overall and according to the use of menopausal hormone therapy (MHT). DESIGN: Between 1995 and 2008, 2482 invasive breast cancer cases were diagnosed among 57,403 postmenopausal women from the E3N prospective cohort during 581,085 person-years. Vitamin D supplementation was assessed from biennially self-administered questionnaires sent in 1995, 2000, 2002, and 2005 and from medico-administrative data on drug reimbursements since 2004. Multivariable HRs for primary invasive breast cancer and 95% CIs were estimated by using Cox models. RESULTS: A decreased postmenopausal breast cancer risk was associated with current (HR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.69, 0.97) but not past (HR: 1.10; 95% CI: 0.92, 1.31) vitamin D supplementation (P-homogeneity = 0.02).

The direct addition of these components to liquid or fabricated solid foods has led to a wide range of new products appearing on the market. Osmotic dehydration, an operation in which food stuff is soaked in solution of low water activity, has been reported as a suitable technology for formulating new products because of the twofold effect that it has on food where it partially removes water and impregnates the food pieces (solid food matrix) with solutes from the osmotic solution. The article focuses on the impregnation of bioactive constituents having added advantage to human health such as antioxidants, minerals, vitamins, and probiotics. The infusion of enzymes and aroma also has been discussed. Application of ultrasound, vacuum, high pressure, and/or atmospheric impregnation techniques appears to be the feasible technologies for impregnation of solid food matrix for the incorporation of bioactive ingredients.", "25674817": "Application of the Key Events Dose-response Framework to Folate Metabolism.\nFolate is a vitamin that plays a role as a cofactor and coenzyme in many essential reactions. These reactions are interrelated and any change in folate homeostasis could affect other reactions. With food fortified with folic acid, and use of multivitamin, unmetabolized folic acid (UMFA) has been detected in blood circulation, particularly among older adults. This has raised concern about the potential harmful effect of high folic acid intake and UMFA on health conditions such as cognitive dysfunction and cancer. To examine what is known about folate metabolism and the release of circulating UMFA, the Key Events Dose-Response Framework (KEDRF) was used to review each of the major key events, dose-response characteristics and homeostatic mechanisms of folate metabolism. The intestine, liver and kidneys each play essential roles in regulating body folate homeostasis. But the determining event in folate metabolism leading to the release of UMFA in circulation appears to be the saturation of dihydrofolate reductase in the liver. However, at each of the key events in folate metabolism, limited information is available on threshold, homeostatic regulation and intracellular effects of folic acid. More studies are needed to fill in the knowledge gaps for quantitatively characterizing the dose-effect relationship especially in light of the call for extending folate fortification to other foods.", "25332337": "Intravenous glutamine supplementation enhances renal de novo arginine synthesis in humans: a stable isotope study.\nBACKGROUND: Arginine plays a role in many different pathways in multiple cell types. Consequently, a shortage of arginine, caused by pathologic conditions such as cancer or injury, has the potential to disturb many cellular and organ functions. Glutamine is the ultimate source for de novo synthesis of arginine in humans via the intestinal-renal axis. Therefore, we hypothesized that parenteral glutamine supplementation may stimulate the interorgan pathway of arginine production. OBJECTIVES: The objectives were to quantify arginine production from its precursor glutamine and to establish the contribution of the kidneys to de novo synthesis of arginine in patients receiving intravenous supplementation of glutamine dipeptide during major abdominal surgery. DESIGN: Whole-body and renal metabolism of glutamine, citrulline, and arginine was assessed by stable isotope techniques in 7 patients receiving a perioperative supplement of intravenous alanyl-glutamine (0.5 g \u00b7 kg(-1) \u00b7 d(-1)). RESULTS: Plasma glutamine, citrulline, and arginine concentrations increased significantly in patients receiving intravenous glutamine dipeptide. At whole-body level, 91% of total citrulline turnover was derived from glutamine, whereas 49% of whole-body citrulline turnover was used for de novo synthesis of arginine. The kidneys were responsible for 75% of whole-body arginine production from citrulline. CONCLUSIONS: Glutamine and citrulline are important sources for de novo arginine synthesis. The kidneys are the main production site for endogenous arginine. After comparison of these results with previous similar studies, our data suggest that an intravenous glutamine supplement doubles renal arginine production from citrulline.

OBJECTIVE: We tested whether improving women's dietary micronutrient quality before conception and throughout pregnancy increases birth weight in a high-risk Indian population. DESIGN: The study was a nonblinded, individually randomized controlled trial. The intervention was a daily snack made from green leafy vegetables, fruit, and milk (treatment group) or low-micronutrient vegetables (potato and onion) (control group) from \u2265 90 d before pregnancy until delivery in addition to the usual diet. Treatment snacks contained 0.69 MJ of energy (controls: 0.37 MJ) and 10-23% of WHO Reference Nutrient Intakes of \u03b2-carotene, riboflavin, folate, vitamin B-12, calcium, and iron (controls: 0-7%). The primary outcome was birth weight. RESULTS: Of 6513 women randomly assigned, 2291 women became pregnant, 1962 women delivered live singleton newborns, and 1360 newborns were measured. In an intention-to-treat analysis, there was no overall increase in birth weight in the treatment group (+26 g; 95% CI: -15, 68 g; P = 0.22). There was an interaction (P < 0.001) between the allocation group and maternal prepregnant body mass index (BMI; in kg/m(2)) [birth-weight effect: -23, +34, and +96 g in lowest (<18.6), middle (18.6-21.8), and highest (>21.8) thirds of BMI, respectively]. In 1094 newborns whose mothers started supplementation \u2265 90 d before pregnancy (per-protocol analysis), birth weight was higher in the treatment group (+48 g; 95% CI: 1, 96 g; P = 0.046). Again, the effect increased with maternal BMI (-8, +79, and +113 g; P-interaction = 0.001). There were similar results for LBW (intention-to-treat OR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.66, 1.05; P = 0.10; per-protocol OR = 0.76; 95% CI: 0.59, 0.98; P = 0.03) but no effect on gestational age in either analysis. CONCLUSIONS: A daily snack providing additional green leafy vegetables, fruit, and milk before conception and throughout pregnancy had no overall effect on birth weight. Per-protocol and subgroup analyses indicated a possible increase in birth weight if the mother was supplemented \u2265 3 mo before conception and was not underweight.

OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the effects of prenatal LNS supplementation on fetal growth. DESIGN: In a community-based, partially double-blind, individually randomized controlled trial, 1320 women \u226420 wk pregnant received 60 mg Fe/400 \u03bcg folic acid (IFA), or 1-2 Recommended Dietary Allowances of 18 micronutrients, including 20 mg Fe (MMN), or LNS with the same micronutrients as the MMN group, plus 4 minerals and macronutrients contributing 118 kcal (LNS) daily until delivery. Fetal growth was compared across groups by using intention-to-treat analysis. The primary outcome was birth length. RESULTS: This analysis included 1057 women (IFA = 349, MMN = 354, LNS = 354). Groups did not differ significantly in mean birth length, length-for-age z score (LAZ), head circumference, or percentage low birth length but differed in mean birth weight (P = 0.044), weight-for-age z score (WAZ; P = 0.046), and BMI-for-age z score (BMIZ; P = 0.040), with a trend toward differences in low birth weight (P = 0.069). In pairwise comparisons, the LNS group had greater mean birth weight (+85 g; P = 0.040), WAZ (+0.19; P = 0.045), and BMIZ (+0.21; P = 0.035) and a lower risk of low birth weight (RR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.39, 0.96; P = 0.032) than did the IFA group. The other group differences were not significant. The effect of intervention was modified by mother's parity, age, height, baseline hemoglobin, household food insecurity, and child sex, with parity being the most consistent modifier. Among primiparous women (IFA = 131; MMN = 110; LNS = 128), the LNS group had greater mean birth length (+0.91 cm; P = 0.001), LAZ (+0.47; P = 0.001), weight (+237 g; P < 0.001), WAZ (+0.56; P < 0.001), BMIZ (+0.52; P < 0.001), head circumference (0.50 cm; P = 0.017), and head circumference-for-age z score (+0.40; P = 0.022) than did the IFA group; similar differences were found when comparing the LNS and MMN groups among primiparous women, and no group differences were found among multiparous women.

Children with FASD often exhibit delayed or abnormal mental, neural, and physical growth. Socioeconomic status, race, genetics, parity, gravidity, age, smoking, and alcohol consumption patterns are all factors that may influence FASD. Optimal maternal nutritional status is of utmost importance for proper fetal development, yet is often altered with alcohol consumption. It is critical to determine a means to resolve and reduce the physical and neurological malformations that develop in the fetus as a result of prenatal alcohol exposure. Because there is a lack of information on the role of nutrients and prenatal nutrition interventions for FASD, the focus of this review is to provide an overview of nutrients (vitamin A, docosahexaenoic acid, folic acid, zinc, choline, vitamin E, and selenium) that may prevent or alleviate the development of FASD. Results from various nutrient supplementation studies in animal models and FASD-related research conducted in humans provide insight into the plausibility of prenatal nutrition interventions for FASD. Further research is necessary to confirm positive results, to determine optimal amounts of nutrients needed in supplementation, and to investigate the collective effects of multiple-nutrient supplementation.", "26065435": "Design of whey protein nanostructures for incorporation and release of nutraceutical compounds in food.\nWhey proteins are widely used as nutritional and functional ingredients in formulated foods because they are relatively inexpensive, generally recognized as safe (GRAS) ingredient, and possess important biological, physical, and chemical functionalities. Denaturation and aggregation behavior of these proteins is of particular relevance toward manufacture of novel nanostructures with a number of potential uses. When these processes are properly engineered and controlled, whey proteins may be formed into nanohydrogels, nanofibrils, or nanotubes and be used as carrier of bioactive compounds. This review intends to discuss the latest understandings of nanoscale phenomena of whey protein denaturation and aggregation that may contribute for the design of protein nanostructures. Whey protein aggregation and gelation pathways under different processing and environmental conditions such as microwave heating, high voltage, and moderate electrical fields, high pressure, temperature, pH, and ionic strength were critically assessed. Moreover, several potential applications of nanohydrogels, nanofibrils, and nanotubes for controlled release of nutraceutical compounds (e.g. probiotics, vitamins, antioxidants, and peptides) were also included. Controlling the size of protein networks at nanoscale through application of different processing and environmental conditions can open perspectives for development of nanostructures with new or improved functionalities for incorporation and release of nutraceuticals in food matrices.", "25569557": "A Review of Potential Marine-derived Hypotensive and Anti-obesity Peptides.\nBioactive peptides are food derived components, usually consisting of 3-20 amino acids, which are inactive when incorporated within their parent protein. Once liberated by enzymatic or chemical hydrolysis, during food processing and gastrointestinal transit, they can potentially provide an array of health benefits to the human body. Owing to an unprecedented increase in the worldwide incidence of obesity and hypertension, medical researchers are focusing on the hypotensive and anti-obesity properties of nutritionally derived bioactive peptides. The role of the renin-angiotensin system has long been established in the aetiology of metabolic diseases and hypertension. Targeting the renin-angiotensin system by inhibiting the activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and preventing the formation of angiotensin II can be a potential therapeutic approach to the treatment of hypertension and obesity. Fish-derived proteins and peptides can potentially be excellent sources of bioactive components, mainly as a source of ACE inhibitors. However, increased use of marine sources, poses an unsustainable burden on particular fish stocks, so, the underutilized fish species and by-products can be exploited for this purpose. This paper provides an overview of the techniques involved in the production, isolation, purification, and characterization of bioactive peptides from marine sources, as well as the evaluation of the ACE inhibitory (ACE-I) activity and bioavailability.", "25877495": "Brain atrophy in cognitively impaired elderly: the importance of long-chain \u03c9-3 fatty acids and B vitamin status in a randomized controlled trial.\nBACKGROUND: Increased brain atrophy rates are common in older people with cognitive impairment, particularly in those who eventually convert to Alzheimer disease. Plasma concentrations of omega-3 (\u03c9-3) fatty acids and homocysteine are associated with the development of brain atrophy and dementia. OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether plasma \u03c9-3 fatty acid concentrations (eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid) modify the treatment effect of homocysteine-lowering B vitamins on brain atrophy rates in a placebo-controlled trial (VITACOG). DESIGN: This retrospective analysis included 168 elderly people (\u226570 y) with mild cognitive impairment, randomly assigned either to placebo (n = 83) or to daily high-dose B vitamin supplementation (folic acid, 0.8 mg; vitamin B-6, 20 mg; vitamin B-12, 0.5 mg) (n = 85). The subjects underwent cranial magnetic resonance imaging scans at baseline and 2 y later. The effect of the intervention was analyzed according to tertiles of baseline \u03c9-3 fatty acid concentrations. RESULTS: There was a significant interaction (P = 0.024) between B vitamin treatment and plasma combined \u03c9-3 fatty acids (eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid) on brain atrophy rates. In subjects with high baseline \u03c9-3 fatty acids (>590 \u03bcmol/L), B vitamin treatment slowed the mean atrophy rate by 40.0% compared with placebo (P = 0.023). B vitamin treatment had no significant effect on the rate of atrophy among subjects with low baseline \u03c9-3 fatty acids (<390 \u03bcmol/L). High baseline \u03c9-3 fatty acids were associated with a slower rate of brain atrophy in the B vitamin group but not in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: The beneficial effect of B vitamin treatment on brain atrophy was observed only in subjects with high plasma \u03c9-3 fatty acids. It is also suggested that the beneficial effect of \u03c9-3 fatty acids on brain atrophy may be confined to subjects with good B vitamin status.

Because many non-Western immigrants in the Netherlands are vitamin D deficient, obese, and at high risk of diabetes, vitamin D supplementation may contribute to prevent diabetes and insulin resistance. OBJECTIVE: We examined the effect of vitamin D supplementation on insulin sensitivity and \u03b2 cell function in overweight, vitamin D-deficient, non-Western immigrants at high risk of diabetes. DESIGN: The study was a 16-wk, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. A total of 130 non-Western immigrants with prediabetes (fasting glucose concentration >5.5 mmol/L or random glucose concentration from 7.8 to 11.1 mmol/L) and vitamin D deficiency (serum 25[OH]D concentration <50 nmol/L) were randomly assigned after stratification by sex to receive either cholecalciferol (1200 IU/d) or a placebo for 16 wk. All participants received 500 mg Ca/d as calcium carbonate. The primary outcome was the difference in the area under the curve of insulin and glucose after a 75-g oral-glucose-tolerance test after 4 mo of treatment. Secondary outcomes were insulin-sensitivity variables, \u03b2 cell-function variables, and metabolic syndrome. RESULTS: Mean serum 25(OH)D concentrations increased significantly in the vitamin D compared with placebo groups. After 4 mo of therapy, the mean between-group difference was 38 nmol/L (95% CI: 32.1, 43.9 nmol/L; P < 0.001). There was no significant effect on insulin sensitivity and \u03b2 cell function. In a post hoc analysis, when patients with diabetes at baseline were excluded, a significant increase in the insulinogenic index was observed in participants who obtained a 25(OH)D concentration \u226560 nmol/L (P = 0.040). CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D supplementation in non-Western vitamin D-deficient immigrants with prediabetes did not improve insulin sensitivity or \u03b2 cell function or change the incidence of metabolic syndrome. However, after the exclusion of diabetic subjects, an improvement in the insulinogenic index was observed in participants who obtained a 25(OH)D concentration \u226560 nmol/L.

An insufficiency of cellular pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP), which is the coenzyme form of vitamin B-6, may impair many metabolic processes including one-carbon and tryptophan metabolism. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the effects of vitamin B-6 supplementation on the in vivo kinetics of one-carbon metabolism and the concentration of one-carbon and tryptophan metabolites in vitamin B-6-deficient OC users. DESIGN: A primed, constant infusion of [(13)C5]methionine, [3-(13)C]serine, and [(2)H3]leucine was performed on 10 OC users (20-40 y old; plasma PLP concentrations <30 nmol/L) before and after 28 d of supplementation with 10 mg pyridoxine hydrochloric acid/d. In vivo fluxes of total homocysteine remethylation, the remethylation of homocysteine from serine, and rates of homocysteine and cystathionine production were assessed. Targeted metabolite profiling was performed, and data were analyzed by using orthogonal partial least-squares-discriminant analysis and paired t tests adjusted for multiple testing. RESULTS: Pyridoxine supplementation increased the mean \u00b1 SD plasma PLP concentration from 25.8 \u00b1 3.6 to 143 \u00b1 58 nmol/L (P < 0.001) and decreased the leucine concentration from 103 \u00b1 17 to 90 \u00b1 20 nmol/L (P = 0.007) and glycine concentration from 317 \u00b1 63 to 267 \u00b1 58 nmol/L (P = 0.03). Supplementation did not affect in vivo rates of homocysteine remethylation or the appearance of homocysteine and cystathionine. A multivariate analysis showed a clear overall effect on metabolite profiles resulting from supplementation. Leucine, glycine, choline, cysteine, glutathione, trimethylamine N-oxide, and the ratios glycine:serine, 3-hydroxykynurenine:kynurenine, 3-hydroxykynurenine:3-hydroxyanthranilic acid, and 3-hydroxykynurenine:anthranilic acid were significant discriminating variables. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with previous vitamin B-6-restriction studies, fluxes of one-carbon metabolic processes exhibited little or no change after supplementation in low-vitamin B-6 subjects. In contrast, changes in the metabolic profiles after supplementation indicated perturbations in metabolism, suggesting functional vitamin B-6 deficiency.

It is a major public health problem in many countries around the world. Over the years various methods have been used with an effort to try and control iron-deficiency anemia. However, there has only been a marginal reduction in the global prevalence of anemia. Why is this so? Iron and zinc are essential trace elements for humans. These metals influence the transport and absorption of one another across the enterocytes and hepatocytes, due to similar ionic properties. This paper describes the structure and roles of major iron and zinc transport proteins, clarifies iron-zinc interactions at these sites, and provides a model for the mechanism of these interactions both at the local and systemic level. This review provides evidence that much of the massive extent of iron deficiency anemia in the world may be due to an underlying deficiency of zinc. It explains the reasons for predominance of cellular zinc status in determination of iron/zinc interactions and for the first time thoroughly explains mechanisms by which zinc brings about these changes.", "25751788": "Are food compounds able to modulate noxious activities induced by cadmium exposure?\nCadmium is one of the most toxic environmental and industrial pollutants and is able to induce severe injury because it is poorly excreted, accumulating in various organs. This common pollutant is responsible for serious damage in lung, brain, testis, kidney, liver, circulatory system, and bone. Food compounds, such as flavonoids, represent the most abundant polyphenols in human diet and comprise thousands of substances, which are freely available as high-dose dietary supplements. The mechanism of action of these ones consists in free radical scavenging and metal sequestration. The interaction of metal ions with flavonoids leads to chelation and the use of these natural compounds is better than the synthetic ones due to their lower toxic effects. The aim of this review is to describe the role of some food compounds, focusing on flavonoids for modulating noxious biological activities induced by cadmium exposure.", "25733650": "High folic acid consumption leads to pseudo-MTHFR deficiency, altered lipid metabolism, and liver injury in mice.\nBACKGROUND: Increased consumption of folic acid is prevalent, leading to concerns about negative consequences. The effects of folic acid on the liver, the primary organ for folate metabolism, are largely unknown. Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) provides methyl donors for S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) synthesis and methylation reactions. OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to investigate the impact of high folic acid intake on liver disease and methyl metabolism. DESIGN: Folic acid-supplemented diet (FASD, 10-fold higher than recommended) and control diet were fed to male Mthfr(+/+) and Mthfr(+/-) mice for 6 mo to assess gene-nutrient interactions. Liver pathology, folate and choline metabolites, and gene expression in folate and lipid pathways were examined. RESULTS: Liver and spleen weights were higher and hematologic profiles were altered in FASD-fed mice. Liver histology revealed unusually large, degenerating cells in FASD Mthfr(+/-) mice, consistent with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. High folic acid inhibited MTHFR activity in vitro, and MTHFR protein was reduced in FASD-fed mice. 5-Methyltetrahydrofolate, SAM, and SAM/S-adenosylhomocysteine ratios were lower in FASD and Mthfr(+/-) livers. Choline metabolites, including phosphatidylcholine, were reduced due to genotype and/or diet in an attempt to restore methylation capacity through choline/betaine-dependent SAM synthesis. Expression changes in genes of one-carbon and lipid metabolism were particularly significant in FASD Mthfr(+/-) mice. The latter changes, which included higher nuclear sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1, higher Srepb2 messenger RNA (mRNA), lower farnesoid X receptor (Nr1h4) mRNA, and lower Cyp7a1 mRNA, would lead to greater lipogenesis and reduced cholesterol catabolism into bile. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that high folic acid consumption reduces MTHFR protein and activity levels, creating a pseudo-MTHFR deficiency. This deficiency results in hepatocyte degeneration, suggesting a 2-hit mechanism whereby mutant hepatocytes cannot accommodate the lipid disturbances and altered membrane integrity arising from changes in phospholipid/lipid metabolism. These preliminary findings may have clinical implications for individuals consuming high-dose folic acid supplements, particularly those who are MTHFR deficient.", "26718419": "Capsaicin-induced satiety is associated with gastrointestinal distress but not with the release of satiety hormones.\nBACKGROUND: Capsaicin, which is the major pungent principle in chili peppers, is able to induce satiety and reduce caloric intake. The exact mechanism behind this satiating effect is still unknown. We hypothesized that capsaicin induces satiety through the release of gastrointestinal peptides, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY), from enteroendocrine cells in the small intestine. OBJECTIVE: We investigate the effects of an intraduodenal capsaicin infusion (1.5 mg pure capsaicin) in healthy volunteers on hunger, satiety, and gastrointestinal symptoms and the release of GLP-1 and PYY. DESIGN: Thirteen participants (7 women) [mean \u00b1 SEM age: 21.5 \u00b1 0.6 y; body mass index (in kg/m(2)): 22.8 \u00b1 0.6] participated in this single-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study with 2 different treatments. During test days, an intraduodenal infusion of either capsaicin or a placebo (physiologic saline) was performed with the use of a nasoduodenal catheter over a period of 30 min. Visual analog scale scores were used to measure hunger, satiety, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Blood samples were drawn at regular intervals for GLP-1 and PYY. Gallbladder volumes were measured with the use of real-time ultrasonography. RESULTS: The intraduodenal capsaicin infusion significantly increased satiety (P-treatment effect < 0.05) but also resulted in an increase in the gastrointestinal symptoms pain (P-treatment \u00d7 time interaction < 0.0005), burning sensation (P-treatment \u00d7 time interaction < 0.0001), nausea (P-treatment \u00d7 time interaction < 0.05), and bloating (P-treatment \u00d7 time interaction < 0.001) compared with the effects of the placebo infusion. Satiety scores had a positive correlation with all gastrointestinal symptoms. No differences in GLP-1 and PYY concentrations and gallbladder volumes were observed after the capsaicin infusion compared with after the placebo infusion. CONCLUSIONS: An intraduodenal infusion of capsaicin significantly increases satiety but does not affect plasma concentrations of GLP-1 and PYY. Rather, the effect on satiety seems related to gastrointestinal stress as shown by the associations with pain, burning sensation, nausea, and bloating scores.

However, to our knowledge, the effect of krill-oil supplementation on insulin sensitivity in humans has not been reported. OBJECTIVE: We assessed whether supplementation with a blend of krill and salmon (KS) oil [which is rich in eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)] affects insulin sensitivity in overweight men. DESIGN: The design was a randomized, double-blind, controlled crossover trial. A total of 47 men with a mean \u00b1 SD age of 46.5 \u00b1 5.1 y, who were overweight [body mass index (in kg/m(2)) from 25 to 30] but otherwise healthy, received 5 1-g capsules of KS oil or a control (canola oil) for 8 wk and crossed over to another treatment after an 8-wk washout period. The primary outcome was insulin sensitivity assessed by using the Matsuda method from an oral-glucose-tolerance test. Secondary outcomes included lipid profiles, inflammatory markers, 24-h ambulatory blood pressure, and carotid artery intimamedia thickness. RESULTS: Unexpectedly, insulin sensitivity (per the Matsuda index) was 14% lower with the KS oil than with the control oil (P = 0.049). A mediation analysis showed that, after controlling for the likely positive effects of blood EPA and DHA (i.e., the omega-3 index), the reduction in insulin sensitivity after KS-oil supplementation was more marked [27% lower than with the control oil (P = 0.009)]. CONCLUSIONS: Supplementation with a blend of KS oil is associated with decreased insulin sensitivity. Thus, krill-oil supplementation in overweight adults could exacerbate risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

In contrast, results from some preclinical studies and cardiovascular and chemoprevention trials have raised concerns that high folate intake may promote carcinogenesis by facilitating the progression of established neoplasia. OBJECTIVE: We tested the hypothesis that higher total folate intake (including food folate and folic acid from fortified foods and supplements) or other one-carbon nutrient intakes might be associated with poorer survival after a diagnosis of colorectal cancer. DESIGN: We used rectal and colon cancer cases within the following 2 US prospective cohort studies: the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study. Biennial questionnaires were used to gather information on medical history and lifestyle factors, including smoking and alcohol consumption. B-vitamin and methionine intakes were derived from food-frequency questionnaires. Data on tumor molecular characteristics (including microsatellite instability, CpG island methylator phenotype, KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA mutations, and long interspersed nucleotide element 1 methylation level) were available for a subset of cases. We assessed colorectal cancer-specific mortality according to postdiagnostic intakes of one-carbon nutrients with the use of multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models. RESULTS: In 1550 stage I-III colorectal cancer cases with a median follow-up of 14.9 y, we documented 641 deaths including 176 colorectal cancer-specific deaths. No statistically significant associations were observed between postdiagnostic intakes of folate or other one-carbon nutrients and colorectal cancer-specific mortality (multivariate P-trend \u2265 0.21). In an exploratory molecular pathologic epidemiology survival analysis, there was no significant interaction between one-carbon nutrients or alcohol and any of the tumor molecular biomarkers examined. CONCLUSIONS: Higher postdiagnostic intakes of one-carbon nutrients are not associated with the prognosis in stage I-III colorectal cancer. Our findings do not support the hypothesis that higher folate intake after colorectal cancer diagnosis might increase risk of cancer-related death.", "25008853": "Vitamin E and C supplementation and risk of cancer in men: posttrial follow-up in the Physicians' Health Study II randomized trial.\nBACKGROUND: Recent posttrial analysis of a completed randomized trial found an increased risk of prostate cancer among healthy men taking high-dose vitamin E supplements. Trials that examined the effect of vitamin C supplements on cancer risk are few. OBJECTIVE: We examined whether vitamin E or vitamin C supplementation affects the risk of cancer events during posttrial follow-up of the Physicians' Health Study II. DESIGN: Beginning in 1997, a total of 14,641 US male physicians aged \u226550 y were randomly assigned to receive 400 IU of vitamin E every other day, 500 mg of vitamin C daily, or their respective placebos.

RESULTS: This study included an additional 356 cases of incident prostate cancer and 771 total cancers that developed during a mean (maximum) of 2.8 (3.8) y of posttrial observation. During an overall mean of 10.3 (13.8) y, there were a total of 1373 incident prostate cancers and 2669 total cancers documented. In comparison with placebo, vitamin E supplementation had no effect on the incidence of prostate cancer (HR: 0.99; 95% CI: 0.89, 1.10) or total cancers (HR: 1.02; 95% CI: 0.95, 1.10). There was also no effect of vitamin C supplementation on total cancers (HR: 1.02; 95% CI: 0.94, 1.10) or incident prostate cancer (HR: 1.03; 95% CI: 0.93, 1.15). Neither vitamin E nor vitamin C supplementation had effects on other site-specific cancers overall. Stratification by known cancer risk factors, history of cancer, other randomized treatment, and follow-up time showed no significant interactions. CONCLUSION: In this large-scale randomized trial in men, vitamin E and C supplementation had no immediate or long-term effects on the risk of total cancers, prostate cancer, or other site-specific cancers.", "24829473": "\u03c9-3 fatty acid supplementation as a potential therapeutic aid for the recovery from mild traumatic brain injury/concussion.\nSports-related concussions or mild traumatic brain injuries (mTBIs) are becoming increasingly recognized as a major public health concern; however, no effective therapy for these injuries is currently available. \u03c9-3 (n-3) fatty acids, such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have important structural and functional roles in the brain, with established clinical benefits for supporting brain development and cognitive function throughout life. Consistent with these critical roles of DHA in the brain, accumulating evidence suggests that DHA may act as a promising recovery aid, or possibly as a prophylactic nutritional measure, for mTBI. Preclinical investigations demonstrate that dietary consumption of DHA provided either before or after mTBI improves functional outcomes, such as spatial learning and memory. Mechanistic investigations suggest that DHA influences multiple aspects of the pathologic molecular signaling cascade that occurs after mTBI. This review examines the evidence of interactions between DHA and concussion and discusses potential mechanisms by which DHA helps the brain to recover from injury. Additional clinical research in humans is needed to confirm the promising results reported in the preclinical literature.", "25747270": "Walnuts (Juglans regia) Chemical Composition and Research in Human Health.\nWalnuts are among the most widely consumed commercially grown tree nuts in the world. Many health benefits have been claimed for the consumption of these, including reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease, type II diabetes treatment, and prevention and treatment of certain cancers, and the lessening of symptoms attributed to age-related and other neurological disorders. The health-promoting benefits of walnut consumption are ascribed to its fatty acid profile, which is rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids with a particularly high \u03c93:\u03c96 ratio-the highest among all the tree nuts. The content of polyphenols and other phytochemicals in walnuts, with their claimed cytotoxic properties, also make them an attractive candidate for research for the prevention of free radical-induced nucleic acid damage. Research of walnut consumption in humans and animals employing a range of data sets and statistical methods suggest that walnuts may be considered a safe potential nutraceutical or possibly pharmaceutical substance. Nevertheless, few reviews of scientific research on the proposed benefits of these nuts exist, in spite of the numerous claims attributed to them in the lay media. This brief review article attempts to disseminate much of the information surrounding walnut consumption, and human health benefits, to other scientists and the interested general reader.", "26675779": "Vitamin D content in human breast milk: a 9-mo follow-up study.\nBACKGROUND: Parents are advised to avoid the direct sun exposure of their newborns. Therefore, the vitamin D status of exclusively breastfed newborns is entirely dependent on the supply of vitamin D from breast milk. OBJECTIVES: We explored concentrations of ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) and cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) (vitamin D) and 25-hydroxivitamin D2 plus D3 (25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]) in foremilk and hindmilk during the first 9 mo of lactation and identified indexes of importance to the concentrations. DESIGN: We collected blood and breast-milk samples from mothers at 2 wk (n = 107), 4 mo, (n = 90), and 9 mo (n = 48) postpartum. Blood samples from infants were collected 4 and 9 mo after birth. We measured concentrations of vitamin D metabolites in blood and milk samples with the use of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Concentrations of vitamin D and 25(OH)D correlated significantly and were higher in hindmilk than in foremilk. Milk concentrations were also correlated with maternal plasma 25(OH)D concentrations. In foremilk and hindmilk, concentrations were a median (IQR) of 1.35% (1.04-1.84%) and 2.10% (1.63-2.65%), respectively, of maternal plasma 25(OH)D concentrations (P < 0.01). Milk concentrations showed a significant seasonal variation. Mothers who were taking vitamin D supplements had higher concentrations than did nonusers. Medians (IQRs) of infant daily intake through breast milk of vitamin D and 25(OH)D were 0.10 \u03bcg (0.02-0.40 \u03bcg) and 0.34 \u03bcg (0.24-0.47 \u03bcg), respectively, which were equal to a median (IQR) antirachitic activity of 77 IU/d (52-110 IU/d). CONCLUSIONS: The supply of vitamin D from breast milk is limited.

Other GI malignancies such as esophageal carcinoma have shown an increasing trend in the last few years. The poor survival statistics of these fatal cancer diseases highlight the need for multiple alternative treatment options along with effective prophylactic strategies. Worldwide geographical variation in cancer incidence indicates a correlation between dietary habits and cancer risk. Epidemiological studies have suggested that populations with high intake of certain dietary agents in their regular meals have lower cancer rates. Thus, an impressive embodiment of evidence supports the concept that dietary factors are key modulators of cancer including those of GI origin. Preclinical studies on animal models of carcinogenesis have reflected the pharmacological significance of certain dietary agents called as nutraceuticals in the chemoprevention of GI neoplasia. These include stilbenes (from red grapes and red wine), isoflavones (from soy), carotenoids (from tomatoes), curcuminoids (from spice turmeric), catechins (from green tea), and various other small plant metabolites (from fruits, vegetables, and cereals). Pleiotropic action mechanisms have been reported for these diet-derived chemopreventive agents to retard, block, or reverse carcinogenesis. This review presents a prophylactic approach to primary prevention of GI cancers by highlighting the translational potential of plant-derived nutraceuticals from epidemiological, laboratory, and clinical studies, for the better management of these cancers through consumption of nutraceutical rich diets and their intervention in cancer therapeutics.", "25099552": "Cross-sectional analysis of calcium intake for associations with vascular calcification and mortality in individuals with type 2 diabetes from the Diabetes Heart Study.\nBACKGROUND: The use of calcium supplements to prevent declines in bone mineral density and fractures is widespread in the United States, and thus reports of elevated cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in users of calcium supplements are a major public health concern. Any elevation in CVD risk with calcium supplement use would be of particular concern in individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) because of increased risks of CVD and fractures observed in this population. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we examined associations between calcium intake from diet and supplements and measures of subclinical CVD (calcified plaque in the coronary artery, carotid artery, and abdominal aorta) and mortality in individuals affected by T2D. DESIGN: We performed a cross-sectional analysis in individuals affected by T2D from the family-based Diabetes Heart Study (n = 720). RESULTS: We observed no significant associations of calcium from diet or supplements with any of our measures of calcified plaque, and no greater mortality risk was observed with increased calcium intake. Instead, calcium supplement use was modestly associated with reduced all-cause mortality in women (HR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.42, 0.92; P = 0.017).

Additionally, many foods and beverages are increasingly being fortified with single or multiple vitamins and minerals. Consequently, nutrient intakes are exceeding the safe limits established by the Institute of Medicine. In this paper, we examine the benefits and drawbacks of vitamin and mineral supplements and increasing consumption of fortified foods (in addition to dietary intake) in the U.S. POPULATION: The pros and cons are illustrated using population estimates of folic acid, calcium, and vitamin D intake, highlighting concerns related to overconsumption of nutrients that should be addressed by regulatory agencies.", "26269367": "High concentrations of folate and unmetabolized folic acid in a cohort of pregnant Canadian women and umbilical cord blood.\nBACKGROUND: Mandatory fortification, prevalent supplement use, and public health guidelines recommending periconceptional supplementation have increased folic acid intakes in North American pregnant women. However, the effects of increased folic acid intakes during pregnancy on maternal and cord blood folate concentrations have not been well established. OBJECTIVES: In this prospective study, we determined maternal and cord blood concentrations of folate and unmetabolized folic acid (UMFA) in a cohort of pregnant Canadian women and their newborns and examined the effect of maternal intakes of folate and folic acid and fetal genetic variants in folate metabolism on folate status. DESIGN: Folate and folic acid intakes of 368 Canadian pregnant women were assessed in early (0-16 wk) and late (23-37 wk) pregnancy. Blood concentrations of folate and UMFA were measured with the use of immunoassays and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, respectively, in maternal samples in early pregnancy (12-16 wk), at delivery (28-42 wk), and in cord blood. Four fetal genetic variants of the 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) genes were assessed for their association with cord blood concentrations of folate and UMFA. RESULTS: Geometric mean (95% CI) maternal red blood cell (RBC) folate concentrations were 2417 nmol/L (2362, 2472 nmol/L ) and 2793 nmol/L (2721, 2867 nmol/L ) in early pregnancy and at delivery, respectively. The mean (95% CI) cord RBC folate concentration was 2689 nmol/L (2614, 2765 nmol/L). UMFA was detectable in >90% of maternal and cord plasma samples. Although 3 fetal MTHFR and DHFR genetic variants had no effect, the fetal MTHFR 677TT genotype was associated with significantly lower cord serum (P = 0.03) and higher cord RBC (P = 0.02) folate concentrations than those of the wild type. CONCLUSIONS: Notwithstanding differences in assays, maternal and cord RBC folate and plasma UMFA concentrations were higher than previously reported values. Functional ramifications of high folate and UMFA concentrations in maternal and fetal circulation warrant additional investigation because an excess folate status may affect long-term health outcomes of the offspring.

This review aims to evaluate the efficacy of RYR on blood pressure (BP), lipid profile, and C-reactive protein (CRP) in treating hypertension. Seven electronic databases including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, PubMed, the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), the Chinese Scientific Journal Database (VIP), the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), and the Wanfang database were searched. To investigate the role of RYR for hypertension, randomized controlled trials for the use of RYR either as monotherapy or in combination with conventional medicine versus placebo, no intervention, or conventional medicine for hypertension were identified. A total of 21 trials containing 4558 patients were analyzed, the majority of which had low methodological quality. \"RYR plus conventional therapy\" exhibited significant lowering effects on serum total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and CRP but exhibited no significant effect on systolic BP, diastolic BP, triglycerides (TG), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) compared with \"placebo plus conventional therapy.\" \"RYR plus conventional therapy\" showed significant lowering effects on systolic BP, TC, LDL-C, and CRP but no effect on diastolic BP, TG, and HDL-C compared with \"placebo plus conventional therapy.\" No significant difference in BP and lipid profile between \"RYR plus conventional therapy\" and \"statins plus conventional therapy\" was observed. \"RYR plus statins\" appeared to be more effective in lowering BP, TC, TG, and LDL-C but without a significant difference in HDL-C compared to statins. No serious adverse events were reported. The results of this meta-analysis suggested some supportive but limited evidence regarding RYR for hypertension. Further rigorously designed trials are warranted before RYR could be recommended to hypertensive patients.", "25875150": "Evidence for the effects of yogurt on gut health and obesity.\nObesity is associated with increased risk for chronic diseases, and affects both developed and developing nations. Yogurt is a nutrient-dense food that may benefit individuals with lactose intolerance, constipation and diarrheal diseases, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and certain types of cancer. Emerging evidence suggests that yogurt consumption might also improve the health of obese individuals. Obesity is often accompanied by chronic, low-grade inflammation perpetuated by adipose tissue and the gut. In the gut, obesity-associated dysregulation of microbiota and impaired gut barrier function may increase endotoxin exposure. Intestinal barrier function can be compromised by pathogens, inflammatory cytokines, endocannabinoids, diet, exercise, and gastrointestinal peptides. Yogurt consumption may improve gut health and reduce chronic inflammation by enhancing innate and adaptive immune responses, intestinal barrier function, lipid profiles, and by regulating appetite. While this evidence suggests that yogurt consumption is beneficial for obese individuals, randomized-controlled trials are needed to further support this hypothesis.", "24808487": "Interindividual variability of lutein bioavailability in healthy men: characterization, genetic variants involved, and relation with fasting plasma lutein concentration.\nBACKGROUND: Lutein accumulates in the macula and brain, where it is assumed to play physiologic roles. The bioavailability of lutein is assumed to display a high interindividual variability that has been hypothesized to be attributable, at least partly, to genetic polymorphisms. OBJECTIVES: We characterized the interindividual variability in lutein bioavailability in humans, assessed the relation between this variability and the fasting blood lutein concentration, and identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) involved in this phenomenon. DESIGN: In a randomized, 2-way crossover study, 39 healthy men consumed a meal that contained a lutein supplement or the same meal for which lutein was provided through a tomato puree. The lutein concentration was measured in plasma chylomicrons isolated at regular time intervals over 8 h postprandially. Multivariate statistical analyses were used to identify a combination of SNPs associated with the postprandial chylomicron lutein response (0-8-h area under the curve). A total of 1785 SNPs in 51 candidate genes were selected. RESULTS: Postprandial chylomicron lutein responses to meals were very variable (CV of 75% and 137% for the lutein-supplement meal and the meal with tomato-sourced lutein, respectively). Postprandial chylomicron lutein responses measured after the 2 meals were positively correlated (r = 0.68, P < 0.0001) and positively correlated to the fasting plasma lutein concentration (r = 0.51, P < 0.005 for the lutein-supplement-containing meal). A significant (P = 1.9 \u00d7 10(-4)) and validated partial least-squares regression model, which included 29 SNPs in 15 genes, explained most of the variance in the postprandial chylomicron lutein response. CONCLUSIONS: The ability to respond to lutein appears to be, at least in part, genetically determined. The ability is explained, in large part, by a combination of SNPs in 15 genes related to both lutein and chylomicron metabolism. Finally, our results suggest that the ability to respond to lutein and blood lutein status are related.

Diet can also change the profile of gut microbiota and, thereby, behavior. Effects of bacteria on the nervous system cannot be disassociated from effects on the immune system since the two are in constant bidirectional communication. While the composition of the gut microbiota varies greatly among individuals, alterations to the balance and content of common gut microbes may affect the production of molecules such as neurotransmitters, e.g., gamma amino butyric acid, and the products of fermentation, e.g., the short chain fatty acids butyrate, propionate, and acetate. Short chain fatty acids, which are pleomorphic, especially butyrate, positively influence host metabolism by promoting glucose and energy homeostasis, regulating immune responses and epithelial cell growth, and promoting the functioning of the central and peripheral nervous systems. In the future, the composition, diversity, and function of specific probiotics, coupled with similar, more detailed knowledge about gut microbiota, will potentially help in developing more effective diet- and drug-based therapies.", "26607935": "Lipid-based nutrient supplements for pregnant women reduce newborn stunting in a cluster-randomized controlled effectiveness trial in Bangladesh.\nBACKGROUND: Maternal undernutrition and newborn stunting [birth length-for-age z score (LAZ) <-2] are common in Bangladesh. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to evaluate the effect of lipid-based nutrient supplements for pregnant and lactating women (LNS-PLs) on birth outcomes. DESIGN: We conducted a cluster-randomized effectiveness trial (the Rang-Din Nutrition Study) within a community health program in rural Bangladesh. We enrolled 4011 pregnant women at \u226420 gestational weeks; 48 clusters received iron and folic acid (IFA; 60 mg Fe + 400 \u03bcg folic acid) and 16 clusters received LNS-PLs (20 g/d, 118 kcal) containing essential fatty acids and 22 vitamins and minerals. Both of the supplements were intended for daily consumption until delivery. Primary outcomes were birth weight and length. RESULTS: Infants in the LNS-PL group had higher birth weights (2629 \u00b1 408 compared with 2588 \u00b1 413 g; P = 0.007), weight-for-age z scores (-1.48 \u00b1 1.01 compared with -1.59 \u00b1 1.02; P = 0.006), head-circumference-for-age z scores (HCZs; -1.26 \u00b1 1.08 compared with -1.34 \u00b1 1.12; P = 0.028), and body mass index z scores (-1.57 \u00b1 1.05 compared with -1.66 \u00b1 1.03; P = 0.005) than those in the IFA group; in adjusted models, the differences in length (47.6 \u00b1 0.07 compared with 47.4 \u00b1 0.04 cm; P = 0.043) and LAZ (-1.15 \u00b1 0.04 compared with -1.24 \u00b1 0.02; P = 0.035) were also significant. LNS-PLs reduced the risk of newborn stunting (18.7% compared with 22.6%; RR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.71, 0.97) and small head size (HCZ <-2) (20.7% compared with 24.9%; RR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.73, 0.98).

Currently, they have an approximated value of $200 per kg and recently, inulin has been proposed as a feedstock for production of oligosaccharides through selective hydrolysis by action of endoinulinase. High optimum temperature (60\u00b0C) and thermostability are two important criteria that determine suitability of this enzyme for industrial applications as well as enzyme cost, a major limiting factor. Significant reduction in cost can be achieved by employing low-value and abundant inulin-rich plants as Jerusalem artichoke, dahlia, yacon, garlic, and onion, among others. In general, the early harvested tubers of these plants contain a greater amount of highly polymerized sugar fractions, which offer more industrial value than late-harvested tubers or those after storage. Also, development of recombinant microorganisms could be useful to reduce the cost of enzyme technology for large-scale production of oligosaccharides. In the case of fungal inulinases, several studies of cloning and modification have been made to achieve greater efficiency. The present paper reviews inulin from vegetable sources as feedstock for oligosaccharides production through the action of inulinases, the impact of polymerization degree of inulin and its availability, and some strategies to increase oligosaccharide production.", "26399865": "High-dose vitamin D3 in adults with pulmonary tuberculosis: a double-blind randomized controlled trial.\nBACKGROUND: Tuberculosis, including multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), is a major global health problem. Individuals with tuberculosis disease commonly exhibit vitamin D deficiency, which may adversely affect immunity and the response to therapy. OBJECTIVE: We determined whether adjunctive high-dose vitamin D3 supplementation improves outcomes in individuals with pulmonary tuberculosis disease. DESIGN: The study was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, intent-to-treat trial in 199 individuals with pulmonary tuberculosis disease in Tbilisi, Georgia. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive oral vitamin D3 [50,000 IUs (1.25 mg) thrice weekly for 8 wk and 50,000 IU every other week for 8 wk] or a placebo concomitant with standard first-line antituberculosis drugs. The primary outcome was the time for the conversion of a Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) sputum culture to negative. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics between groups were similar. Most subjects (74%) were vitamin D deficient (plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration <50 nmol/L). With vitamin D3, plasma 25(OH)D concentrations peaked at \u223c250 nmol/L by 8 wk and decreased to \u223c125 nmol/L at week 16. Adverse events and plasma calcium concentrations were similar between groups. In 192 subjects with culture-confirmed tuberculosis, an adjusted efficacy analysis showed similar median culture-conversion times between vitamin D3 and placebo groups [29 and 27 d, respectively; HR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.63, 1.18; P = 0.33). Eight-week culture-conversion rates were also similar (84.0% and 82.1% for vitamin D3 and placebo, respectively; P = 0.99).

OBJECTIVE: We compared the effect of the PY with LF yogurt consumption on body weight and cardiometabolic risk factors in women during a weight-loss program. DESIGN: Overweight and obese women [body mass index (in kg/m(2)): 27-40; age: 18-50 y) who usually consumed standard LFs were asked to consume either PY or LF every day with their main meals for 12 wk while following a weight-loss program. RESULTS: A total of 89 participants were randomly assigned to one of the 2 intervention groups. Baseline variables were not significantly different between groups. A statistically significant reduction in anthropometric measurements and significant improvements in cardiometabolic risk characteristics were observed over the 12 wk in both groups. However, no significant differences in weight loss and anthropometric measurements were seen between groups after the intervention. Compared with the LF group, the PY group had a greater (mean \u00b1 SD) decrease in total cholesterol (PY = -0.36 \u00b1 0.10 mmol/L, LF = -0.31 \u00b1 0.10 mmol/L; P = 0.024), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (PY = -0.35 \u00b1 0.10 mmol/L, LF = -0.31 \u00b1 0.11 mmol/L; P = 0.018), homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (PY = -0.55 \u00b1 0.32, LF = -0.42 \u00b1 0.20; P = 0.002), 2-h postprandial glucose (PY = -0.61 \u00b1 0.24 mmol/L, LF = -0.44 \u00b1 0.19 mmol/L; P < 0.001), and fasting insulin concentration (PY = -1.76 \u00b1 1.01 mU/mL, LF = -1.32 \u00b1 0.62 mU/mL; P = 0.002), as secondary endpoints after the study. No significant differences were found for fasting plasma glucose, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or triglycerides within both groups after the 12 wk.

Whether the vitamin D content of breast milk at birth can be increased by supplementing the mother during pregnancy has not been reported to the best of our knowledge. OBJECTIVE: We examined the effect of vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy on breast-milk VDA in the first 2 mo of lactation. DESIGN: Breast-milk samples were obtained from women who were enrolled in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy. Pregnant women were enrolled at 27 wk of gestation and randomly assigned to the following 3 groups: a placebo group, a group who received one dosage of daily oral vitamin D3 (1000 IU), or a group who received 2 dosages of daily oral vitamin D3 (2000 IU). Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] was measured at enrollment, at 36 wk of gestation, and in cord blood at birth. Study participants who were breastfeeding were invited to provide breast-milk samples for VDA measurement [concentration of vitamin D2, vitamin D3, 25(OH)D2, and 25(OH)D3] at 2 wk and 2 mo postpartum. A linear mixed model was used to compare breast-milk VDA between the 3 study groups. RESULTS: A total of 75 women provided breast-milk samples (44 women provided breast-milk samples at both 2 wk and 2 mo postpartum). The mean (95% CI) VDA at age 2 wk was 52 IU/L (12, 217 IU/L) in the placebo group, 51 IU/L (17, 151 IU/L) in the 1000-IU group, and 74 IU/L (25, 221 IU/L) in the 2000-IU group; and at age 2 mo, the mean (95% CI) VDA was 45 IU/L (16, 124 IU/L), 43 IU/L (18, 103 IU/L), and 58 IU/L (15, 224 IU/L), respectively. There was no significant interaction in VDA between the sample-collection time and treatment (P = 0.61), but there was a difference between lower- and higher-dosage treatment groups (P = 0.04).

Most studies have assessed 25(OH)D only one time during pregnancy, but to our knowledge, the tracking of an individual's 25(OH)D during pregnancy has not been assessed previously. OBJECTIVE: We determined the tracking of serum 25(OH)D from early to late pregnancy and factors that influence this. DESIGN: The Southampton Women's Survey is a prospective mother-offspring birth-cohort study. Lifestyle, diet, and 25(OH)D status were assessed at 11 and 34 wk of gestation. A Fourier transformation was used to model the seasonal variation in 25(OH)D for early and late pregnancy separately, and the difference between the measured and seasonally modeled 25(OH)D was calculated to generate a season-corrected 25(OH)D. Tracking was assessed with the use of the Pearson correlation coefficient, and multivariate linear regression was used to determine factors associated with the change in season-corrected 25(OH)D. RESULTS: A total of 1753 women had 25(OH)D measured in both early and late pregnancy. There was a moderate correlation between season-corrected 25(OH)D measurements at 11 and 34 wk of gestation (r = 0.53, P < 0.0001; n = 1753). Vitamin D supplementation was the strongest predictor of tracking; in comparison with women who never used supplements, the discontinuation of supplementation after 11 wk was associated with a reduction in season-corrected 25(OH)D (\u03b2 = -7.3 nmol/L; P < 0.001), whereas the commencement (\u03b2 = 12.6 nmol/L; P < 0.001) or continuation (\u03b2 = 6.6 nmol/L; P < 0.001) of supplementation was associated with increases in season-corrected 25(OH)D. Higher pregnancy weight gain was associated with a reduction in season-corrected 25(OH)D (\u03b2 = -0.4 nmol \u00b7 L(-1) \u00b7 kg(-1); P = 0.015), whereas greater physical activity (\u03b2 = 0.4 nmol/L per h/wk; P = 0.011) was associated with increases. CONCLUSIONS: There is a moderate tracking of 25(OH)D status through pregnancy; factors such as vitamin D supplementation, weight gain, and physical activity are associated with changes in season-corrected 25(OH)D from early to late gestation. These findings have implications for study designs and analyses and approaches to intervention studies and clinical care.", "26607937": "Vitamin B-12 treatment of asymptomatic, deficient, elderly Chileans improves conductivity in myelinated peripheral nerves, but high serum folate impairs vitamin B-12 status response assessed by the combined indicator of vitamin B-12 status.\nBACKGROUND: It is uncertain whether vitamin B-12 supplementation can improve neurophysiologic function in asymptomatic elderly with low vitamin B-12 status or whether folate status affects responses to vitamin B-12 supplementation. OBJECTIVE: We assessed the effects of a single intramuscular injection of 10 mg vitamin B-12 (which also contained 100 mg vitamin B-6 and 100 mg vitamin B-1) on vitamin B-12 status and neurophysiologic function in elderly community-dwelling Chileans with low serum vitamin B-12 concentrations who were consuming bread fortified with folic acid. DESIGN: A pretreatment and posttreatment study was conducted in 51 participants (median \u00b1 SD age: 73 \u00b1 3 y; women: 47%) with serum vitamin B-12 concentrations <120 pmol/L at screening. Vitamin B-12 status was defined by combining vitamin B-12, plasma total homocysteine (tHcy), methylmalonic acid (MMA), and holotranscobalamin into one variable [combined indicator of vitamin B-12 status (cB-12)]. The response to treatment was assessed by measuring cB-12 and neurophysiologic variables at baseline and 4 mo after treatment. RESULTS: Treatment increased serum vitamin B-12, holotranscobalamin, and cB-12 (P < 0.001) and reduced plasma tHcy and serum MMA (P < 0.001). Treatment produced consistent improvements in conduction in myelinated peripheral nerves; the sensory latency of both the left and right sural nerves improved on the basis of faster median conduction times of 3.1 and 3.0 ms and 3.3 and 3.4 ms, respectively (P < 0.0001). A total of 10 sensory potentials were newly observed in sural nerves after treatment. Participants with high serum folate at baseline (above the median, \u226533.9 nmol/L) had less improvement in cB-12 (P < 0.001) than did individuals whose serum folate was less than the median concentration (i.e., with a concentration <33.9 nmol/L). CONCLUSION: Asymptomatic Chilean elderly with poor vitamin B-12 status displayed improved conductivity in myelinated peripheral nerves after vitamin B-12 treatment and an interaction with folate status, which was detected only with the use of cB-12.

It is now evident that ALA benefits CVD risk. The expansion of the ALA evidence base has occurred in parallel with ongoing research on eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3) and CVD. The available evidence enables comparisons to be made for ALA vs. EPA + DHA for CVD risk reduction. The epidemiologic evidence suggests comparable benefits of plant-based and marine-derived n-3 (omega-3) PUFAs. The clinical trial evidence for ALA is not as extensive; however, there have been CVD event benefits reported. Those that have been reported for EPA + DHA are stronger because only EPA + DHA differed between the treatment and control groups, whereas in the ALA studies there were diet differences beyond ALA between the treatment and control groups. Despite this, the evidence suggests many comparable CVD benefits of ALA vs. EPA + DHA. Thus, we believe that it is time to revisit what the contemporary dietary recommendation should be for ALA to decrease the risk of CVD. Our perspective is that increasing dietary ALA will decrease CVD risk; however, randomized controlled clinical trials are necessary to confirm this and to determine what the recommendation should be. With a stronger evidence base, the nutrition community will be better positioned to revise the dietary recommendation for ALA for CVD risk reduction.", "25733653": "Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis fails to prevent common infections in hospitalized children: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.\nBACKGROUND: The incidence of nosocomial infections in children in developed countries is still high, ranging from 8% to 30%, and standard preventive measures, such as increased hygiene, are not sufficiently efficacious. One of the potential strategies for their prevention is the use of probiotics. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to investigate the role of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis in preventing nosocomial infections in the acute hospital setting. DESIGN: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 727 hospitalized children (aged 1-18 y). The children were randomly allocated to receive placebo (placebo group, n = 365) or B. animalis subsp. lactis at a dose of 10(9) colony-forming units/d (intervention group, n = 362) once daily for the entire duration of the hospital stay. Nosocomial infections were defined as infections that occurred >48 h after hospital admission and that were not present or incubating at the time of admission. RESULTS: Analysis was performed on an intention-to-treat basis. There was no difference in the study primary outcome or incidence of common nosocomial gastrointestinal and respiratory tract infections between groups (22 vs. 29 infections, respectively; incidence rate ratio = 0.76; 95% CI: 0.41, 1.36; P = 0.32). No difference was found for the duration of common nosocomial infections [mean (range): 3.58 (1-7) vs. 3.79 (1-8) d, in placebo vs. intervention group; P = 0.74]. There was also no difference between the intervention and placebo groups for any of the other secondary outcomes (incidence of gastrointestinal and respiratory tract infections separately, duration of gastrointestinal and respiratory infections, and duration of hospitalization) and exploratory outcomes (gastrointestinal and respiratory symptoms, severity of gastrointestinal and respiratory tract infections, and the use of antibiotics). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study show that the use of B. animalis subsp. lactis failed to prevent nosocomial infections in an acute-setting pediatric hospital in children who were >1 y of age. However, it should be taken into account that the overall incidence of nosocomial infections was lower than expected.

OBJECTIVE: We tested the hypothesis that periconceptional multiple-micronutrient supplementation (MMS) affects placental function. DESIGN: We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of MMS in 17- to 45-y-old Gambian women who were menstruating regularly and within the previous 3 mo. Eligible subjects were pre-randomly assigned to supplementation with the UNICEF/WHO/United Nations University multiple micronutrient preparation (UNIMMAP) or placebo on recruitment and until they reached their first antenatal check-up or for 1 y if they failed to conceive. Primary outcome measures were midgestational indexes of utero-placental vascular-endothelial function [ratio of plasminogen-activator inhibitor (PAI) 1 to PAI-2 and mean uterine-artery resistance index (UtARI)] and placental active transport capacity at delivery [fetal to maternal measles antibody (MMA) ratio]. RESULTS: We recruited 1156 women who yielded 415 pregnancies, of which 376 met all of the inclusion criteria. With adjustment for gestational age at sampling, there were no differences in PAI-1 to PAI-2 or MMA ratios between trial arms, but there was a 0.02-unit reduction in UtARI between 18 and 32 wk of gestation (95% CI: -0.03, -0.00; P = 0.040) in women taking UNIMMAP. CONCLUSIONS: Placental vascular function was modifiable by periconceptional micronutrient supplementation. However, the effect was small and supplementation did not further affect other variables of placental function. This trial was registered at www.controlled-trials.com as ISRCTN 13687662.", "24808485": "Evidence for increased catabolism of vitamin B-6 during systemic inflammation.\nBACKGROUND: Plasma concentrations of PL 5'-phosphate (PLP), which is the active coenzyme form of vitamin B-6, are reduced during inflammation. The underlying mechanisms may include altered tissue distribution or increased catabolism via pyridoxal (PL) to pyridoxic acid (PA). Recently, we showed that catabolic enzyme activity could be assessed by substrate product ratios measured in plasma. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the ratios PA:PL, PA:PLP, and PA:(PL + PLP) as possible markers of vitamin B-6 catabolism. DESIGN: Cross-sectional and longitudinal data were derived from the Western Norway B-Vitamin Intervention Trial. We analyzed associations of ratios with inflammatory markers and other clinical variables by using multiple linear regression and partial correlation. In addition, intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were used to assess the ability of plasma indexes to differentiate between subjects. RESULTS: PA:(PL + PLP) had the highest ICC of all vitamin B-6 metabolites and ratios tested. In regression models, the inflammatory markers C-reactive protein, white blood cell count, neopterin, and kynurenine:tryptophan collectively accounted for 28% of the total and > 90% of the explained variation in PA:(PL + PLP). For individual B-6 metabolites, corresponding numbers were 19-25% and 20-44%, respectively, with vitamin supplement intake, smoking, and kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration rate) as additional predictors. In an analysis of receiver operating characteristics, PA:(PL + PLP) discriminated high inflammatory concentrations with an area under the curve (95% CI) of 0.85 (0.81, 0.89). CONCLUSIONS: Broad-specificity enzymes upregulated to reduce oxidative and aldehyde stress could explain increased catabolism of vitamin B-6 during inflammation. The ratio PA:(PL + PLP) may provide novel insights into pathologic processes and potentially predict risk of future disease.", "25008857": "Effect of oral magnesium supplementation on physical performance in healthy elderly women involved in a weekly exercise program: a randomized controlled trial.\nBACKGROUND: Magnesium deficiency is associated with poor physical performance, but no trials are available on how magnesium supplementation affects elderly people's physical performance. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to investigate whether 12 wk of oral magnesium supplementation can improve physical performance in healthy elderly women. DESIGN: In a parallel-group, randomized controlled trial, 139 healthy women (mean \u00b1 SD age: 71.5 \u00b1 5.2 y) attending a mild fitness program were randomly allocated to a treatment group (300 mg Mg/d; n = 62) or a control group (no placebo or intervention; n = 77) by using a computer-generated randomization sequence, and researchers were blinded to their grouping. After assessment at baseline and again after 12 wk, the primary outcome was a change in the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB); secondary outcomes were changes in peak torque isometric and isokinetic strength of the lower limbs and handgrip strength. RESULTS: A total of 124 participants allocated to the treatment (n = 53) or control (n = 71) group were considered in the final analysis. At baseline, the SPPB scores did not differ between the 2 groups. After 12 wk, the treated group had a significantly better total SPPB score (\u0394 = 0.41 \u00b1 0.24 points; P = 0.03), chair stand times (\u0394 = -1.31 \u00b1 0.33 s; P < 0.0001), and 4-m walking speeds (\u0394 = 0.14 \u00b1 0.03 m/s; P = 0.006) than did the control group. These findings were more evident in participants with a magnesium dietary intake lower than the Recommended Dietary Allowance. No significant differences emerged for the secondary outcomes investigated, and no serious adverse effects were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Daily magnesium oxide supplementation for 12 wk seems to improve physical performance in healthy elderly women. These findings suggest a role for magnesium supplementation in preventing or delaying the age-related decline in physical performance.", "24944062": "Folic acid handling by the human gut: implications for food fortification and supplementation.\nBACKGROUND: Current thinking, which is based mainly on rodent studies, is that physiologic doses of folic acid (pterylmonoglutamic acid), such as dietary vitamin folates, are biotransformed in the intestinal mucosa and transferred to the portal vein as the natural circulating plasma folate, 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid (5-MTHF) before entering the liver and the wider systemic blood supply. OBJECTIVE: We tested the assumption that, in humans, folic acid is biotransformed (reduced and methylated) to 5-MTHF in the intestinal mucosa. DESIGN: We conducted a crossover study in which we sampled portal and peripheral veins for labeled folate concentrations after oral ingestion with physiologic doses of stable-isotope-labeled folic acid or the reduced folate 5-formyltetrahydrofolic acid (5-FormylTHF) in 6 subjects with a transjugular intrahepatic porto systemic shunt (TIPSS) in situ. The TIPSS allowed blood samples to be taken from the portal vein. RESULTS: Fifteen minutes after a dose of folic acid, 80 \u00b1 12% of labeled folate in the hepatic portal vein was unmodified folic acid. In contrast, after a dose of labeled 5-FormylTHF, only 4 \u00b1 18% of labeled folate in the portal vein was unmodified 5-FormylTHF, and the rest had been converted to 5-MTHF after 15 min (postdose). CONCLUSIONS: The human gut appears to have a very efficient capacity to convert reduced dietary folates to 5-MTHF but limited ability to reduce folic acid. Therefore, large amounts of unmodified folic acid in the portal vein are probably attributable to an extremely limited mucosal cell dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) capacity that is necessary to produce tetrahydrofolic acid before sequential methylation to 5-MTHF. This process would suggest that humans are reliant on the liver for folic acid reduction even though it has a low and highly variable DHFR activity. Therefore, chronic liver exposure to folic acid in humans may induce saturation, which would possibly explain reports of systemic circulation of unmetabolized folic acid.", "26558644": "Probiotic potentials of cereal-based beverages.\nProbiotics offer remarkable potential for the prevention and management of various infective and noninfective disorders. They are reported to play key roles in the suppression of gastrointestinal infections, antimicrobial activity, improvement in lactose metabolism, reduction in serum cholesterol, immune system stimulation, antimutagenic properties, anticarcinogenic properties, anti-diarrheal properties, and improvement in inflammatory bowel disease. Although probiotic foods are classically confined to beverages and cheese, containing live organisms of the lactic acid bacteria family, such health-promoting foods are traditionally dairy-based, comprising milk and its fermented products. However, recent research focuses on the probiotic potentials of fermented cereal-based beverages which are especially consumed in developing countries characterized by low nutritional security and high incidence of gut pathogen infections. Moreover, lactose intolerance and cholesterol content associated with dairy products, coupled with the vegetarian tendencies of diverse populations in the third world, tend to enforce the recent recourse to nondairy beverages. Probiotic microorganisms are mostly of human or animal origin; however, strains recognized as probiotics are also found in nondairy fermented substrates. This review examines the potentials of some traditional cereal-based beverages to serve as probiotic foods, their microbial and functional properties, as well as their process optimization and storage for enhanced utilization.", "25880137": "Iodine Deficiency and the Brain: Effects and Mechanisms.\nIodine is an essential micronutrient needed in human diets. As iodine is an integral component of thyroid hormone, it mediates the effects of thyroid hormone on brain development. Iodine deficiency is the most prevalent and preventable cause of mental impairment in the world. The exact mechanism through which iodine influences the brain is unclear, but is generally thought to begin with genetic expression. Many brain structures and systems appear to be affected with iodine deficiency, including areas such as the hippocampus, microstructures such as myelin, and neurotransmitters. The clearest evidence comes from the studies examining cognition in the cases of iodine deprivation or interventions involving iodine supplementation. Nevertheless, there are many inconsistencies and gaps in the literature of iodine deficiency, especially over the lifespan. This paper summarizes the literature on this topic, suggests a causal mechanism for iodine's effect on the brain, and indicates areas for the future research (e.g., using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional MRI to examine how iodine supplementation facilitates cognitive functioning).", "25099542": "The effect of probiotics on functional constipation in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.\nBACKGROUND: Functional constipation is a prevalent, burdensome gastrointestinal disorder whose treatment remains challenging. Probiotics have been increasingly investigated in its management. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to investigate the effect of probiotics on gut transit time, stool output, and constipation symptoms in adults with functional constipation via a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). DESIGN: Studies were identified by searching 4 electronic databases, back-searching reference lists, contacting authors, and hand-searching abstracts. RCTs that reported administration of probiotics in adults with functional constipation were included. Two reviewers independently performed the screening, data extraction, and bias assessment. Outcome data were synthesized by using weighted mean differences (WMDs) or standardized mean differences (SMDs) with the use of a random-effects model. RESULTS: A total of 660 records were identified of which 14 were eligible (1182 patients). Overall, probiotics significantly reduced whole gut transit time by 12.4 h (95% CI: -22.3, -2.5 h) and increased stool frequency by 1.3 bowel movements/wk (95% CI: 0.7, 1.9 bowel movements/wk), and this was significant for Bifidobacterium lactis (WMD: 1.5 bowel movements/wk; 95% CI: 0.7, 2.3 bowel movements/wk) but not for Lactobacillus casei Shirota (WMD: -0.2 bowel movements/wk; 95% CI: -0.8, 0.9 bowel movements/wk). Probiotics improved stool consistency (SMD: +0.55; 95% CI: 0.27, 0.82), and this was significant for B. lactis (SMD: +0.46; 95% CI: 0.08, 0.85) but not for L. casei Shirota (SMD: +0.26; 95% CI: -0.30, 0.82). No serious adverse events were reported. Attrition and reporting bias were high, whereas selection bias was unclear due to inadequate reporting. CONCLUSIONS: Probiotics may improve whole gut transit time, stool frequency, and stool consistency, with subgroup analysis indicating beneficial effects of B. lactis in particular. However, caution is needed with the interpretation of these data due to their high heterogeneity and risk of bias. Adequately powered RCTs are required to better determine the species or strains, doses, and duration of use of probiotics that are most efficacious.", "25411277": "Effect of n-3 PUFA supplementation on cognitive function throughout the life span from infancy to old age: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.\nBACKGROUND: n-3 PUFAs play an important role in cognitive function. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to investigate the effect of n-3 PUFA supplements on cognitive development, function, and decline throughout the life span. DESIGN: The study included randomized controlled trials and provided \u22653 mo of treatment. Potential studies were independently screened in duplicate, and study characteristics and outcomes were extracted. A meta-analysis was performed by using fixed- or random-effects models. The results are presented as standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95% CIs. RESULTS: Of the 3692 citations retrieved, 34 studies of a total of 12,999 participants (1031 infants, 1517 children, 3657 adults, and 6794 elderly individuals) were included. Compared with placebo, n-3 PUFA supplements significantly improved cognitive development in infants, including the Mental Development Index (SMD: 0.33; 95% CI: 0.15, 0.52), the Psychomotor Development Index (0.27; 95% CI: 0.09, 0.45), and language (0.27; 95% CI: 0.13, 0.42), motor (0.29; 95% CI: 0.14, 0.43), and cognitive (0.31; 95% CI: 0.16, 0.45) abilities. However, n-3 PUFAs did not promote cognitive function in terms of composite memory, executive function, and processing speed domains in children, adults, or the elderly, except for the attention domain. No association was found between n-3 PUFA intake and improvements in cognitive performance in terms of recognition, immediate and delayed word recall, digit span backward and forward tests, rapid visual information processing, verbal fluency, and simple and choice reaction times. In addition, n-3 PUFA supplements were not associated with improvements in cognitive decline or with any effects on Alzheimer disease in elderly people. CONCLUSIONS: n-3 PUFA supplements may significantly improve cognitive development in infants but do not improve cognitive performance in children, adults, or the elderly. n-3 PUFA intake, especially that of DHA supplements, may benefit cognitive development during infancy.", "26377161": "No increase in risk of hip fracture at high serum retinol concentrations in community-dwelling older Norwegians: the Norwegian Epidemiologic Osteoporosis Studies.\nBACKGROUND: Norway has the highest hip fracture rates worldwide and a relatively high vitamin A intake. Increased fracture risk at high intakes and serum concentrations of retinol (s-retinol) have been observed in epidemiologic studies. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to study the association between s-retinol and hip fracture and whether high s-retinol may counteract a preventive effect of vitamin D. DESIGN: We conducted the largest prospective analysis of serum retinol and hip fracture to date in 21,774 men and women aged 65-79 y (mean age: 72 y) who attended 4 community-based health studies during 1994-2001. Incident hip fractures occurring up to 10.7 y after baseline were retrieved from electronic hospital discharge registers. Retinol determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection in stored serum was available in 1154 incident hip fracture cases with valid body mass index (BMI) data and in a subcohort defined as a sex-stratified random sample (n = 1418). Cox proportional hazards regression weighted according to the stratified case-cohort design was performed. RESULTS: There was a modest increased risk of hip fracture in the lowest compared with the middle quintile of s-retinol (HR: 1.41; 95% CI: 1.09, 1.82) adjusted for sex and study center. The association was attenuated after adjustment for BMI and serum concentrations of \u03b1-tocopherol (HR: 1.16; 95% CI: 0.88, 1.51). We found no increased risk in the upper compared with the middle quintile. No significant interaction between serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and s-retinol on hip fracture was observed (P = 0.68). CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence of an adverse effect of high serum retinol on hip fracture or any interaction between retinol and 25-hydroxyvitamin D. If anything, there tended to be an increased risk at low retinol concentrations, which was attenuated after control for confounders. We propose that cod liver oil, a commonly used food supplement in Norway, should not be discouraged as a natural source of vitamin D for fracture prevention.", "25240073": "Maternal choline concentrations during pregnancy and choline-related genetic variants as risk factors for neural tube defects.\nBACKGROUND: Low maternal choline intake and blood concentration may be risk factors for having a child with a neural tube defect (NTD); however, the data are inconsistent. This is an important question to resolve because choline, if taken periconceptionally, might add to the protective effect currently being achieved by folic acid. OBJECTIVE: We examined the relation between NTDs, choline status, and genetic polymorphisms reported to influence de novo choline synthesis to investigate claims that taking choline periconceptionally could reduce NTD rates. DESIGN: Two study groups of pregnant women were investigated: women who had a current NTD-affected pregnancy (AP; n = 71) and unaffected controls (n = 214) and women who had an NTD in another pregnancy but not in the current pregnancy [nonaffected pregnancy (NAP); n = 98] and unaffected controls (n = 386). Blood samples to measure betaine and total choline concentrations and single nucleotide polymorphisms related to choline metabolism were collected at their first prenatal visit. RESULTS: Mean (\u00b1SD) plasma total choline concentrations in the AP (2.8 \u00b1 1.0 mmol/L) and control (2.9 \u00b1 0.9 mmol/L) groups did not differ significantly. Betaine concentrations were not significantly different between the 2 groups. Total choline and betaine in the NAP group did not differ from controls. Cases were significantly more likely to have the G allele of phosphatidylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase (PEMT; V175M, +5465 G>A) rs7946 (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that maternal betaine and choline concentrations are not strongly associated with NTD risk. The association between PEMT rs7946 and NTDs requires confirmation. The addition of choline to folic acid supplements may not further reduce NTD risk.", "26675768": "Biofortified yellow cassava and vitamin A status of Kenyan children: a randomized controlled trial.\nBACKGROUND: Whereas conventional white cassava roots are devoid of provitamin A, biofortified yellow varieties are naturally rich in \u03b2-carotene, the primary provitamin A carotenoid. OBJECTIVE: We assessed the effect of consuming yellow cassava on serum retinol concentration in Kenyan schoolchildren with marginal vitamin A status. DESIGN: We randomly allocated 342 children aged 5-13 y to receive daily, 6 d/wk, for 18.5 wk 1) white cassava and placebo supplement (control group), 2) provitamin A-rich cassava (mean content: 1460 \u03bcg \u03b2-carotene/d) and placebo supplement (yellow cassava group), and 3) white cassava and \u03b2-carotene supplement (1053 \u03bcg/d; \u03b2-carotene supplement group). The primary outcome was serum retinol concentration; prespecified secondary outcomes were hemoglobin concentration and serum concentrations of \u03b2-carotene, retinol-binding protein, and prealbumin. Groups were compared by using ANCOVA, adjusting for inflammation, baseline serum concentrations of retinol and \u03b2-carotene, and stratified design. RESULTS: The baseline prevalence of serum retinol concentration <0.7 \u03bcmol/L and inflammation was 27% and 24%, respectively. For children in the control, yellow cassava, and \u03b2-carotene supplement groups, the mean daily intake of cassava was 378, 371, and 378 g, respectively, and the total daily supply of provitamin A and vitamin A from diet and supplements was equivalent to 22, 220, and 175 \u03bcg retinol, respectively. Both yellow cassava and \u03b2-carotene supplementation increased serum retinol concentration by 0.04 \u03bcmol/L (95% CI: 0.00, 0.07 \u03bcmol/L); correspondingly, serum \u03b2-carotene concentration increased by 524% (448%, 608%) and 166% (134%, 202%). We found no effect on hemoglobin concentration or serum concentrations of retinol-binding protein and prealbumin. CONCLUSIONS: In our study population, consumption of yellow cassava led to modest gains in serum retinol concentration and a large increase in \u03b2-carotene concentration. It can be an efficacious, new approach to improve vitamin A status.

OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to assess the effects of magnesium supplementation on metabolic status and pregnancy outcomes in magnesium-deficient pregnant women with GDM. DESIGN: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was performed in 70 women with GDM. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either 250 mg magnesium oxide (n = 35) or a placebo (n = 35) for 6 wk. Fasting blood samples were taken at baseline and after a 6-wk intervention. RESULTS: The change in serum magnesium concentration was greater in women consuming magnesium than in the placebo group (+0.06 \u00b1 0.3 vs. -0.1 \u00b1 0.3 mg/dL, P = 0.02). However, after controlling for baseline magnesium concentrations, the changes in serum magnesium concentrations were not significantly different between the groups. Changes in fasting plasma glucose (-9.7 \u00b1 10.1 vs. +1.8 \u00b1 8.1 mg/dL, P < 0.001), serum insulin concentration (-2.1 \u00b1 6.5 vs. +5.7 \u00b1 10.7 \u03bcIU/mL, P = 0.001), homeostasis model of assessment-estimated insulin resistance (-0.5 \u00b1 1.3 vs. +1.4 \u00b1 2.3, P < 0.001), homeostasis model of assessment-estimated \u03b2-cell function (-4.0 \u00b1 28.7 vs. +22.0 \u00b1 43.8, P = 0.006), and the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (+0.004 \u00b1 0.021 vs. -0.012 \u00b1 0.015, P = 0.005) in supplemented women were significantly different from those in women in the placebo group. Changes in serum triglycerides (+2.1 \u00b1 63.0 vs. +38.9 \u00b1 37.5 mg/dL, P = 0.005), high sensitivity C-reactive protein (-432.8 \u00b1 2521.0 vs. +783.2 \u00b1 2470.1 ng/mL, P = 0.03), and plasma malondialdehyde concentrations (-0.5 \u00b1 1.6 vs. +0.3 \u00b1 1.2 \u03bcmol/L, P = 0.01) were significantly different between the supplemented women and placebo group. Magnesium supplementation resulted in a lower incidence of newborn hyperbilirubinemia (8.8% vs. 29.4%, P = 0.03) and newborn hospitalization (5.9% vs. 26.5%, P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Magnesium supplementation among women with GDM had beneficial effects on metabolic status and pregnancy outcomes.

Lycopene is consumed primarily as the all-trans geometric isomer in foods, whereas human plasma and tissues show greater proportions of cis isomers. OBJECTIVE: With the use of compartmental modeling and stable isotope technology, we determined whether endogenous all-trans-to-cis-lycopene isomerization or isomeric-bioavailability differences underlie the greater proportion of lycopene cis isomers in human tissues than in tomato foods. DESIGN: Healthy men (n = 4) and women (n = 4) consumed (13)C-lycopene (10.2 mg; 82% all-trans and 18% cis), and plasma was collected over 28 d. Unlabeled and (13)C-labeled total lycopene and lycopene-isomer plasma concentrations, which were measured with the use of high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, were fit to a 7-compartment model. RESULTS: Subjects absorbed a mean \u00b1 SEM of 23% \u00b1 6% of the lycopene. The proportion of plasma cis-(13)C-lycopene isomers increased over time, and all-trans had a shorter half-life than that of cis isomers (5.3 \u00b1 0.3 and 8.8 \u00b1 0.6 d, respectively; P < 0.001) and an earlier time to reach maximal plasma concentration than that of cis isomers (28 \u00b1 7 and 48 \u00b1 9 h, respectively). A compartmental model that allowed for interindividual differences in cis- and all-trans-lycopene bioavailability and endogenous trans-to-cis-lycopene isomerization was predictive of plasma (13)C and unlabeled cis- and all-trans-lycopene concentrations. Although the bioavailability of cis (24.5% \u00b1 6%) and all-trans (23.2% \u00b1 8%) isomers did not differ, endogenous isomerization (0.97 \u00b1 0.25 \u03bcmol/d in the fast-turnover tissue lycopene pool) drove tissue and plasma isomeric profiles. CONCLUSION: (13)C-Lycopene combined with physiologic compartmental modeling provides a strategy for following complex in vivo metabolic processes in humans and reveals that postabsorptive trans-to-cis-lycopene isomerization, and not the differential bioavailability of isomers, drives tissue and plasma enrichment of cis-lycopene.

Among the LAB, members of the Lactobacillus casei group have industrial applications as acid-producing starter cultures for milk fermentations and as specialty cultures for the intensification and acceleration of flavor development in certain bacterial-ripened cheese varieties. They are amongst the most common organisms in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of humans and other animals, and have the potential to function as probiotics. Whether used in industrial or probiotic applications, environmental stresses will affect the physiological status and properties of cells, including altering their functionality and biochemistry. Understanding the mechanisms of how LAB cope with different environments is of great biotechnological importance, from both a fundamental and applied perspective: hence, interaction between these strains and their environment has gained increased interest in recent years. This paper presents an overview of the important features of stress responses in Lb. casei, and related proteomic or gene expression patterns that may improve their use as starter cultures and probiotics.", "25733652": "n-3 Long-chain PUFAs reduce respiratory morbidity caused by iron supplementation in iron-deficient South African schoolchildren: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled intervention.\nBACKGROUND: Although iron supplementation in malaria-free areas mostly reduces infectious morbidity, it can sometimes increase morbidity from infections as a result of the dependence of pathogenic microorganisms on iron. Supplementation with n-3 (\u03c9-3) long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) improved morbidity in several human studies. However, information on the combined effect of iron and n-3 LCPUFA supplementation on infectious morbidity is limited. OBJECTIVE: We determined whether n-3 LCPUFAs and iron supplementation, alone or in combination, affected absenteeism and illness in iron-deficient schoolchildren with low fish intake. DESIGN: A total of 321 South African children (aged 6-11 y) with iron deficiency (ID) were randomly divided into 4 groups to receive 1) iron plus placebo, 2) a mixture of docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid (DHA/EPA) plus placebo, 3) iron plus DHA/EPA, or 4) placebo plus placebo as oral supplements 4 times/wk for 8.5 mo. Morbidity was recorded, and iron-status indexes were measured. The total phospholipid fatty acid composition of peripheral blood mononuclear cell membranes was analyzed in a subsample (n = 130). RESULTS: Iron supplementation increased the number of days with illness when all symptoms were considered (B: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.71, 1.03) as well as illness that was specifically caused by respiratory symptoms (B: 1.45; 95% CI: 1.21, 1.70), whereas DHA/EPA reduced the number of days with illness at school (B: -0.96; 95% CI: -1.33, -0.59). The increases caused by iron were reduced to the levels seen in the placebo plus placebo group when iron was provided in combination with DHA/EPA as indicated by significant iron \u00d7 DHA/EPA interactions (both P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Iron supplementation increased morbidity (mostly respiratory) in iron-deficient South African schoolchildren with low DHA/EPA intake, but when iron was given in combination with DHA/EPA, this effect was prevented.", "25733646": "Vitamin supplementation on the risk of venous thrombosis: results from the MEGA case-control study.\nBACKGROUND: Whether vitamin supplements decrease venous thrombosis risk is controversial. Previous reports did not all take confounding fully into account, either by randomization or by extensive adjustment. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to determine whether vitamin supplementation decreases the risk of venous thrombosis. DESIGN: A large case-control study included 2506 patients with venous thrombosis, 2506 partner controls, and 2684 random-digit dialing (RDD) controls. When patients were compared with RDD controls, unconditional logistic regression was used to calculate ORs with 95% CIs. When patients were compared with partner controls, conditional logistic regression was used, providing further adjustment for unmeasured confounding. RESULTS: Vitamin use yielded a 37% lower risk of venous thrombosis than no vitamin use (OR: 0.63; 95% CI: 0.57, 0.70) when comparing patients with RDD controls. Adjustment for several putative confounders did not change the estimate (OR: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.61, 0.77). The fully adjusted ORs for vitamin A, vitamin B-6, vitamin B-12, folic acid, vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin E, and multivitamin use were in the same range. However, when patients were compared with partner controls, ORs attenuated to unity. Results were similar for provoked and unprovoked events, as well as for deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. CONCLUSIONS: After extensive adjustments, vitamin supplementation was no longer associated with a decreased risk of venous thrombosis in this study. Previous positive results may have been spurious as a result of uncontrolled confounding.", "27385610": "The vitamin D status of the US population from 1988 to 2010 using standardized serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D shows recent modest increases.\nBACKGROUND: Temporal trends in the US population's vitamin D status have been uncertain because of nonstandardized serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] measurements. OBJECTIVE: To accurately assess vitamin D status trends among those aged \u226512 y, we used data from the cross-sectional NHANESs. DESIGN: A liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for measuring 25(OH)D (sum of 25-hydroxyvitamin D2 and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3), calibrated to standard reference materials, was used to predict LC-MS/MS-equivalent concentrations from radioimmunoassay data (1988-2006 surveys; n = 38,700) and to measure LC-MS/MS concentrations (2007-2010 surveys; n = 12,446). Weighted arithmetic means and the prevalence of 25(OH)D above or below cutoff concentrations were calculated to evaluate long-term trends. RESULTS: Overall, mean predicted 25(OH)D showed no time trend from 1988 to 2006, but during 2007-2010 the mean measured 25(OH)D was 5-6 nmol/L higher. Those groups who showed the largest 25(OH)D increases (7-11 nmol/L) were older, female, non-Hispanic white, and vitamin D supplement users. During 1988-2010, the proportions of persons with 25(OH)D <40 nmol/L were 14-18% (overall), 46-60% (non-Hispanic blacks), 21-28% (Mexican Americans), and 6-10% (non-Hispanic whites). CONCLUSIONS: An accurate method for measuring 25(OH)D showed stable mean concentrations in the US population (1988-2006) and recent modest increases (2007-2010). Although it is unclear to what extent supplement usage compared with different laboratory methods explain the increases in 25(OH)D, the use of higher vitamin D supplement dosages coincided with the increase. Marked race-ethnic differences in 25(OH)D concentrations were apparent. These data provide the first standardized information about temporal trends in the vitamin D status of the US population.", "28814398": "Plasma lipidomic profiles and cardiovascular events in a randomized intervention trial with the Mediterranean diet.\nBackground: Lipid metabolites may partially explain the inverse association between the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) and cardiovascular disease (CVD).Objective: We evaluated the associations between 1) lipid species and the risk of CVD (myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death); 2) a MedDiet intervention [supplemented with extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) or nuts] and 1-y changes in these molecules; and 3) 1-y changes in lipid species and subsequent CVD.Design: With the use of a case-cohort design, we profiled 202 lipid species at baseline and after 1 y of intervention in the PREDIMED (PREvenci\u00f3n con DIeta MEDiterr\u00e1nea) trial in 983 participants [230 cases and a random subcohort of 790 participants (37 overlapping cases)].Results: Baseline concentrations of cholesterol esters (CEs) were inversely associated with CVD. A shorter chain length and higher saturation of some lipids were directly associated with CVD. After adjusting for multiple testing, direct associations remained significant for 20 lipids, and inverse associations remained significant for 6 lipids. When lipid species were weighted by the number of carbon atoms and double bonds, the strongest inverse association was found for CEs [HR: 0.39 (95% CI: 0.22, 0.68)] between extreme quintiles (P-trend = 0.002). Participants in the MedDiet + EVOO and MedDiet + nut groups experienced significant (P < 0.05) 1-y changes in 20 and 17 lipids, respectively, compared with the control group. Of these changes, only those in CE(20:3) in the MedDiet + nuts group remained significant after correcting for multiple testing. None of the 1-y changes was significantly associated with CVD risk after correcting for multiple comparisons.Conclusions: Although the MedDiet interventions induced some significant 1-y changes in the lipidome, they were not significantly associated with subsequent CVD risk. Lipid metabolites with a longer acyl chain and higher number of double bonds at baseline were significantly and inversely associated with the risk of CVD.", "28724645": "Effect of maternal high dosages of folic acid supplements on neurocognitive development in children at 4-5 y of age: the prospective birth cohort Infancia y Medio Ambiente (INMA) study.\nBackground: The benefits of the use of folic acid supplements (FASs) during the periconception period to prevent neural tube defects and to ensure normal brain development in offspring are well known. There is concern, however, about the long-term effects of the maternal use of high dosages of FASs that exceed the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) (\u22651000 \u03bcg/d) on child neurocognitive outcomes.Objective: The objective of the study was to examine the association between the use of high dosages of FASs during pregnancy and child neuropsychological development at ages 4-5 y.Design: The multicenter prospective mother-child cohort study, the Infancia y Medio Ambiente (INMA) Project, was conducted in 4 regions of Spain: Asturias, Sabadell, Gipuzkoa, and Valencia. Pregnant women were recruited between 2003 and 2008. Data on 1682 mother-child pairs were included in the final analyses. The pregnant women completed an interviewer-administered questionnaire that was validated to estimate typical dietary folate intake and the use of FASs at 10-13 and 28-32 wk of gestation. Neuropsychological development scores at 4-5 y of age were estimated with the use of the McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities. Multiple linear regression and meta-analysis were used to obtain combined-effect estimates.Results: During the periconception period, one-third of the women (n = 502) took FAS dosages \u22651000 \u03bcg/d. The use of FAS dosages \u22651000 \u03bcg/d in this period was negatively associated with several neuropsychological outcomes scores in children: global verbal (\u03b2 = -2.49; 95% CI: -4.71, -0.27), verbal memory (\u03b2 = -3.59; 95% CI: -6.95, -0.23), cognitive function of posterior cortex (\u03b2 = -2.31; 95% CI: -4.45, -0.18), and cognitive function of left posterior cortex (\u03b2 = -3.26; 95% CI: -5.51, -1.01).Conclusions: The use of FAS dosages exceeding the UL (\u22651000 \u03bcg/d) during the periconception period was associated with lower levels of cognitive development in children aged 4-5 y. The use of FAS dosages \u22651000 \u03bcg/d during pregnancy should be monitored and prevented as much as possible, unless medically prescribed.", "28148500": "The influence of genetic susceptibility and calcium plus vitamin D supplementation on fracture risk.\nBackground: Fracture is a complex trait, affected by both genetic and environmental factors. A meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) identified multiple bone mineral density (BMD) and fracture-associated loci.Objective: We conducted a study to evaluate whether fracture genetic risk score (Fx-GRS) and bone mineral density genetic risk score (BMD-GRS) modify the association between the intake of calcium with vitamin D (CaD) and fracture risk.Design: Data from 5823 white postmenopausal women from the Women's Health Initiative CaD randomized trial were included. Participants received 1000 mg elemental Ca with 400 IU vitamin D3/d or placebo (median follow-up: 6.5 y). Total fracture was defined as first fracture of any type. We computed the Fx-GRS with 16 fracture- and BMD-associated variants, and the BMD-GRS with 50 BMD-associated variants. We used Cox regression and a case-only approach to test for multiplicative interaction. Additive interaction was assessed with the relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI). We analyzed genetic risk score as a continuous variable and a categorical variable based on quartile (quartile 1, quartiles 2-3, and quartile 4).Results: We observed no interaction between the Fx-GRS and CaD on fracture risk; however, we observed a significant multiplicative interaction between the BMD-GRS and CaD assignment (P-interaction = 0.01). In addition, there was a significant negative additive interaction between placebo assignment and higher BMD-GRS: quartiles 2-3, PRERI = 0.03; quartile 4, PRERI = 0.03. In a stratified analysis, the protective effect of CaD on fracture risk was observed in women in the lowest BMD-GRS quartile (HR: 0.60, 95% CI: 0.44, 0.81) but not in women with a higher BMD-GRS.Conclusions: We observed significant effects of CaD intake on fracture risk only in women with the lowest genetic predisposition to low BMD. Future large-scale studies with functional characterization of GWAS findings are warranted to assess the utility of genetic risk score in analysis of risks and benefits of CaD for bone.", "28615261": "Increased vitamin D intake differentiated according to skin color is needed to meet requirements in young Swedish children during winter: a double-blind randomized clinical trial.\nBackground: Dark skin and low exposure to sunlight increase the risk of vitamin D insufficiency in children.Objective: The aim of the study was to evaluate the amount of vitamin D needed to ascertain that most children >4 y of age attain sufficient serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [S-25(OH)D; i.e., \u226550 nmol/L] during winter regardless of latitude and skin color.Design: In a longitudinal, double-blind, randomized, food-based intervention study, 5- to 7-y-old children from northern (63\u00b0N) and southern (55\u00b0N) Sweden with fair (n = 108) and dark (n = 98) skin were included. Children, stratified by skin color by using Fitzpatrick's definition, were randomly assigned to receive milk-based vitamin D3 supplements that provided 2 (placebo), 10, or 25 \u03bcg/d during 3 winter months.Results: Mean daily vitamin D intake increased from 6 to 17 \u03bcg and 26 \u03bcg in the intervention groups supplemented with 10 and 25 \u03bcg, respectively. In the intention-to-treat analysis, 90.2% (95% CI: 81.1%, 99.3%) of fair-skinned children randomly assigned to supplementation of 10 \u03bcg/d attained sufficient concentrations, whereas 25 \u03bcg/d was needed in dark-skinned children to reach sufficiency in 95.1% (95% CI: 88.5%, 100%). In children adherent to the study product, 97% (95% CI: 91.3%, 100%) and 87.9% (95% CI: 76.8%, 99%) of fair- and dark-skinned children, respectively, achieved sufficient concentrations if supplemented with 10 \u03bcg/d. By using 95% prediction intervals for 30 and 50 nmol S-25(OH)D/L, intakes of 6 and 20 \u03bcg/d are required in fair-skinned children, whereas 14 and 28 \u03bcg/d are required in children with dark skin.Conclusion: Children with fair and dark skin require vitamin D intakes of 20 and 28 \u03bcg/d, respectively, to maintain S-25(OH)D \u226550 nmol/L, whereas intakes of 6 and 14 \u03bcg/d, respectively, are required to maintain concentrations \u226530 nmol/L during winter.

The purpose of the current article is to summarize and briefly discuss a list of research and resource needs developed with the input of workshop participants. This list is composed of the basic, clinical, translational, and population studies required for characterizing the benefits and risks of iodine supplementation, along with related data, analyses, evaluations, methods development, and supporting activities. Ancillary studies designed to use the participant, biological sample, and data resources of ongoing and completed studies (including those not originally concerned with iodine) may provide an efficient, cost-effective means to address some of these research and resource needs. In the United States, the foremost question is whether neurobehavioral development in the offspring of mildly to moderately iodine-deficient women is improved by maternal iodine supplementation during pregnancy. It is important to identify the benefits and risks of iodine supplementation in all population subgroups so that supplementation can be targeted, if necessary, to avoid increasing the risk of thyroid dysfunction and related adverse health effects in those with high iodine intakes. Ultimately, there will be a need for well-designed trials and other studies to assess the impact of maternal supplementation on neurodevelopmental outcomes in the offspring. However, 2 basic information gaps loom ahead of such a study: the development of robust, valid, and convenient biomarkers of individual iodine status and the identification of infant and toddler neurobehavioral development endpoints that are sensitive to mild maternal iodine deficiency during pregnancy and its reversal by supplementation.", "28096125": "Dietary Supplements and Risk of Cause-Specific Death, Cardiovascular Disease, and Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Primary Prevention Trials.\nOur aim was to assess the efficacy of dietary supplements in the primary prevention of cause-specific death, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and cancer by using meta-analytical approaches. Electronic and hand searches were performed until August 2016. Inclusion criteria were as follows: 1) minimum intervention period of 12 mo; 2) primary prevention trials; 3) mean age \u226518 y; 4) interventions included vitamins, fatty acids, minerals, supplements containing combinations of vitamins and minerals, protein, fiber, prebiotics, and probiotics; and 5) primary outcome of all-cause mortality and secondary outcomes of mortality or incidence from CVD or cancer. Pooled effects across studies were estimated by using random-effects meta-analysis. Overall, 49 trials (69 reports) including 287,304 participants met the inclusion criteria. Thirty-two trials were judged as low risk-, 15 trials as moderate risk-, and 2 trials as high risk-of-bias studies. Supplements containing vitamin E (RR: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.80, 0.96) significantly reduced cardiovascular mortality risk, whereas supplements with folic acid reduced the risk of CVD (RR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.70, 0.94). Vitamins D, C, and K; selenium; zinc; magnesium; and eicosapentaenoic acid showed no significant risk reduction for any of the outcomes. On the contrary, vitamin A was linked to an increased cancer risk (RR: 1.16; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.35). Supplements with \u03b2-carotene showed no significant effect; however, in the subgroup with \u03b2-carotene given singly, an increased risk of all-cause mortality by 6% (RR: 1.06; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.10) was observed. Taken together, we found insufficient evidence to support the use of dietary supplements in the primary prevention of cause-specific death, incidence of CVD, and incidence of cancer. The application of some supplements generated small beneficial effects; however, the heterogeneous types and doses of supplements limit the generalizability to the overall population.", "27465382": "Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations and treatment outcomes of women undergoing assisted reproduction.\nBACKGROUND: Vitamin D deficiency impairs fertility in animal models, but the role of vitamin D in human fertility or treatment of infertility is less clear. OBJECTIVE: We examined the association between circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations and the outcome in women undergoing assisted reproduction technologies (ARTs). DESIGN: We randomly selected 100 women undergoing infertility treatment with ART enrolled in an ongoing prospective cohort study who underwent 168 treatment cycles. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations were measured in samples collected from women between days 3 and 9 of gonadotropin treatment. Generalized linear mixed models were used to evaluate the association of 25(OH)D concentrations with ART outcomes while adjusting for potential confounders and accounting for repeated treatment cycles per woman. RESULTS: Median (range) serum 25(OH)D concentrations were 86.5 (33.5-155.5) nmol/L. Ninety-one percent of participants consumed multivitamins. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations were positively related to fertilization rate. The adjusted fertilization rate for women in increasing quartiles of serum 25(OH)D were 0.62 (95% CI: 0.51, 0.72), 0.53 (95% CI: 0.43, 0.63), 0.67 (95% CI: 0.56, 0.76), and 0.73 (95% CI: 0.63, 0.80), respectively (P-trend = 0.03). This association persisted when analyses were restricted to women with serum 25(OH)D between 50 and 125 nmol/L when models were further adjusted for season of blood draw and when analyses were restricted to the first treatment cycle. However, 25(OH)D concentrations were unrelated to probability of pregnancy (P-trend = 0.83) or live birth after ART (P-trend = 0.47). CONCLUSION: Vitamin D may be associated with higher fertilization rates, but this apparent benefit does not translate into higher probability of pregnancy or live birth.

Adequate intake of folic acid is vital for metabolism, cellular homeostasis, and DNA synthesis. Since the initial discovery of folic acid in the 1940s, folate deficiency has been implicated in numerous disease states, primarily those associated with neural tube defects in utero and neurological degeneration later in life. However, in the past decade, epidemiological studies have identified an inverse relation between both folic acid intake and blood folate concentration and cardiovascular health. This association inspired a number of clinical studies that suggested that folic acid supplementation could reverse endothelial dysfunction in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD). Recently, in vitro and in vivo studies have begun to elucidate the mechanism(s) through which folic acid improves vascular endothelial function. These studies, which are the focus of this review, suggest that folic acid and its active metabolite 5-methyl tetrahydrofolate improve nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability by increasing endothelial NO synthase coupling and NO production as well as by directly scavenging superoxide radicals. By improving NO bioavailability, folic acid may protect or improve endothelial function, thereby preventing or reversing the progression of CVD in those with overt disease or elevated CVD risk.", "28096137": "Introduction to the Yogurt in Nutrition Initiative at the First Symposium of Yogurt in Mexico: The Balanced Diet Initiative.\nIn some European countries, yogurt consumption is common. However, such consumption is not common in Latin America, particularly in Mexico, partially because of the lack of a cultural tradition of consuming yogurt. Moreover, we also know that little information about the health benefits associated with yogurt consumption has been provided to the Mexican population. Thus, there is an immediate need to provide, at least to the nutrition community in the country, current scientific evidence about the health benefits of yogurt, with the aim that yogurt be included as part of the functional foods recommended to the population. Currently, extensive research has been conducted to investigate the mechanisms through which yogurt generates beneficial effects. Gut microbiota appear to be an important factor that can be modified by dietary prebiotics, as well as probiotics such as yogurt. The prevention or attenuation of gut microbiota dysbiosis is now associated with improvements observed in individuals with metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease. Thus, it is important to establish guidelines for the consumption of dairy products, including yogurt. Such guidelines are necessary to increase the consumption of dairy products in Mexico and other countries.", "27351520": "Lactic acid fermentation as a tool for increasing the folate content of foods.\nFolate is an essential micronutrient involved in numerous vital biological reactions. The dietary consumption of naturally occurring vitamin B9 is often inadequate in many countries, and supplementation or fortification programs (using synthetic folic acid) are implemented to alleviate folate deficiency. Other food-based alternatives are possible, such as the use of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) to synthesize folate during fermentation. Many studies have been conducted on this topic, and promising results were reported for some fermented dairy products. However, in other studies, folate consumption by LAB or rather low folate production were observed, resulting in fermented foods that may not significantly contribute to the recommended B9 intake. In addition, the optimum conditions for folate biosynthesis by LAB are still not clear. The aim of this review was thus to (i) clarify the ability of LAB to produce folate in food products, (ii) check if the production of folate by LAB in various fermented foods is sufficient to meet human vitamin B9 requirements and (iii) suggest ways to optimize folate production by LAB in fermented food products.", "27852617": "Sex differences in the effect of fish-oil supplementation on the adaptive response to resistance exercise training in older people: a randomized controlled trial.\nBACKGROUND: Resistance exercise increases muscle mass and function in older adults, but responses are attenuated compared with younger people. Data suggest that long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) may enhance adaptations to resistance exercise in older women. To our knowledge, this possibility has not been investigated in men. OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine the effects of long-chain n-3 PUFA supplementation on resistance exercise training-induced increases in muscle mass and function and whether these effects differ between older men and women. DESIGN: Fifty men and women [men: n = 27, mean \u00b1 SD age: 70.6 \u00b1 4.5 y, mean \u00b1 SD body mass index (BMI; in kg/m2): 25.6 \u00b1 4.2; women: n = 23, mean \u00b1 SD age: 70.7 \u00b1 3.3 y, mean \u00b1 SD BMI: 25.3 \u00b1 4.7] were randomly assigned to either long-chain n-3 PUFA (n = 23; 3 g fish oil/d) or placebo (n = 27; 3 g safflower oil/d) and participated in lower-limb resistance exercise training twice weekly for 18 wk. Muscle size, strength, and quality (strength per unit muscle area), functional abilities, and circulating metabolic and inflammatory markers were measured before and after the intervention. RESULTS: Maximal isometric torque increased after exercise training to a greater (P < 0.05) extent in the long-chain n-3 PUFA group than in the placebo group in women, with no differences (P > 0.05) between groups in men. In both sexes, the effect of exercise training on maximal isokinetic torque at 30, 90, and 240\u00b0 s-1, 4-m walk time, chair-rise time, muscle anatomic cross-sectional area, and muscle fat did not differ (P > 0.05) between groups. There was a greater (P < 0.05) increase in muscle quality in women after exercise training in the long-chain n-3 PUFA group than in the placebo group, with no such differences in men (P > 0.05). Long-chain n-3 PUFAs resulted in a greater decrease (P < 0.05) than the placebo in plasma triglyceride concentrations in both sexes, with no differences (P > 0.05) in glucose, insulin, or inflammatory markers.

These workshops were part of the ongoing ODS Iodine Initiative, begun in 2011 in response to concerns that US pregnant women may be at risk of iodine deficiency and that a high fraction of prenatal dietary supplements do not contain the recommended amounts of iodine. The primary purpose of the workshops was to consider the data and resources necessary to evaluate the clinical and public health benefits and risks of maternal iodine supplementation in the United States. The first workshop focused on the assessment of iodine intake, the second focused on the assessment of iodine status, and the third focused on the design and interpretation of clinical trials of maternal iodine supplementation. Here we provide the background of the ODS Iodine Initiative, summarize the 3 workshops held in 2014, and introduce the articles that arose from the workshops and are published in this supplement issue.", "28148501": "Folic acid therapy reduces serum uric acid in hypertensive patients: a substudy of the China Stroke Primary Prevention Trial (CSPPT).\nBackground: The effect of folic acid supplementation on uric acid (UA) concentrations is still inconclusive.Objective: We aimed to test the efficacy of folic acid therapy in reducing serum UA in hypertensive patients.Design: A total of 15,364 hypertensive patients were randomly assigned to a double-blind daily treatment with a single tablet that contained 10 mg enalapril and 0.8 mg folic acid (n = 7685) or 10 mg enalapril alone (n = 7679). The main outcome was the change in serum UA, which was defined as UA at the exit visit minus that at baseline. Secondary outcomes were as follows: 1) controlled hyperuricemia (UA concentration <357 \u03bcmol/L after treatment) and 2) new-onset hyperuricemia in participants with normal UA concentrations (<357 \u03bcmol/L).Results: After a median of 4.4 y of treatment, the mean \u00b1 SD UA concentration increased by 34.7 \u00b1 72.5 \u03bcmol/L in the enalapril-alone group and by 30.7 \u00b1 71.8 \u03bcmol/L in the enalapril-folic acid group, which resulted in a mean group difference of -4.0 \u03bcmol/L (95% CI: -6.5, -1.6 \u03bcmol/L; P = 0.001). Furthermore, compared with enalapril alone, enalapril-folic acid treatment showed an increase in controlled hyperuricemia (30.3% compared with 25.6%; OR: 1.31; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.70) and a decrease in new-onset hyperuricemia (15.0% compared with 16.3%; OR: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.79, 0.99). A greater beneficial effect was observed in subjects with hyperuricemia (P-interaction = 0.07) or higher concentrations of total homocysteine (tHcy) (P-interaction = 0.02) at baseline. Furthermore, there was a significant inverse relation (P < 0.001) between the reduction of tHcy and the change in UA concentrations.Conclusions: Enalapril-folic acid therapy, compared with enalapril alone, can significantly reduce the magnitude of the increase of UA concentrations in hypertensive adults.

Random- and fixed-effects models were used to estimate the pooled standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95% CIs in changes in BP from baseline to the end of the trial in both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) between the magnesium-supplementation group and the control group.Results: Eleven RCTs that included 543 participants with follow-up periods that ranged from 1 to 6 mo (mean: 3.6 mo) were included in this meta-analysis. The dose of elemental magnesium that was used in the trials ranged from 365 to 450 mg/d. All studies reported BP at baseline and the end of the trial. The weighted overall effects indicated that the magnesium-supplementation group had a significantly greater reduction in both SBP (SMD: -0.20; 95% CI: -0.37, -0.03) and DBP (SMD: -0.27; 95% CI: -0.52, -0.03) than did the control group. Magnesium supplementation resulted in a mean reduction of 4.18 mm Hg in SBP and 2.27 mm Hg in DBP.Conclusion: The pooled results suggest that magnesium supplementation significantly lowers BP in individuals with insulin resistance, prediabetes, or other noncommunicable chronic diseases.", "27281302": "A randomized, crossover, head-to-head comparison of eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid supplementation to reduce inflammation markers in men and women: the Comparing EPA to DHA (ComparED) Study.\nBACKGROUND: To date, most studies on the anti-inflammatory effects of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in humans have used a mixture of the 2 fatty acids in various forms and proportions. OBJECTIVES: We compared the effects of EPA supplementation with those of DHA supplementation (re-esterified triacylglycerol; 90% pure) on inflammation markers (primary outcome) and blood lipids (secondary outcome) in men and women at risk of cardiovascular disease. DESIGN: In a double-blind, randomized, crossover, controlled study, healthy men (n = 48) and women (n = 106) with abdominal obesity and low-grade systemic inflammation consumed 3 g/d of the following supplements for periods of 10 wk: 1) EPA (2.7 g/d), 2) DHA (2.7 g/d), and 3) corn oil as a control with each supplementation separated by a 9-wk washout period. Primary analyses assessed the difference in cardiometabolic outcomes between EPA and DHA. RESULTS: Supplementation with DHA compared with supplementation with EPA led to a greater reduction in interleukin-18 (IL-18) (-7.0% \u00b1 2.8% compared with -0.5% \u00b1 3.0%, respectively; P = 0.01) and a greater increase in adiponectin (3.1% \u00b1 1.6% compared with -1.2% \u00b1 1.7%, respectively; P < 0.001). Between DHA and EPA, changes in CRP (-7.9% \u00b1 5.0% compared with -1.8% \u00b1 6.5%, respectively; P = 0.25), IL-6 (-12.0% \u00b1 7.0% compared with -13.4% \u00b1 7.0%, respectively; P = 0.86), and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (-14.8% \u00b1 5.1% compared with -7.6% \u00b1 10.2%, respectively; P = 0.63) were NS. DHA compared with EPA led to more pronounced reductions in triglycerides (-13.3% \u00b1 2.3% compared with -11.9% \u00b1 2.2%, respectively; P = 0.005) and the cholesterol:HDL-cholesterol ratio (-2.5% \u00b1 1.3% compared with 0.3% \u00b1 1.1%, respectively; P = 0.006) and greater increases in HDL cholesterol (7.6% \u00b1 1.4% compared with -0.7% \u00b1 1.1%, respectively; P < 0.0001) and LDL cholesterol (6.9% \u00b1 1.8% compared with 2.2% \u00b1 1.6%, respectively; P = 0.04). The increase in LDL-cholesterol concentrations for DHA compared with EPA was significant in men but not in women (P-treatment \u00d7 sex interaction = 0.046). CONCLUSIONS: DHA is more effective than EPA in modulating specific markers of inflammation as well as blood lipids. Additional studies are needed to determine the effect of a long-term DHA supplementation per se on cardiovascular disease risk.

OBJECTIVE: To summarize current evidence and standards, recommendations, guidelines, and regulations on nutrition or supplements in lactating women with emphasis placed on long-term health effects in offspring, including cardiovascular disease, hypertension, overweight/obesity, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, or glucose intolerance. METHODS: Medline, Embase, selected databases and websites were searched for documents published between 2010 and 2015. RESULTS: Thirteen documents met the inclusion criteria. Effects of maternal long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LC-PUFA) supplementation on overweight/obesity or hypertension in offspring were assessed in 10 studies. One study described the effect of maternal vitamin D supplementation on overweight/obesity, and the remaining 2 studies assessed the effects of maternal probiotic/synbiotic supplementation during lactation on overweight/obesity or metabolic syndrome in their infants. Forty-one documents contained dietary recommendations on various macro- and micronutrients for lactating women, but without consideration of our long-term health outcomes in infants. CONCLUSION: Literature on nutrition of lactating women and its effect on their infants' later health with respect to metabolic programming outcomes appeared to be scarce, and focused mostly on supplementation of LC-PUFA's. No recent guidelines or recommendations were available, highlighting the significant research gaps regarding this topic.", "27655438": "Estimation of the dietary requirement for vitamin D in adolescents aged 14-18 y: a dose-response, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial.\nBACKGROUND: Adolescents are a population group at high risk of low vitamin D status, yet the evidence base for establishing dietary vitamin D requirements remains weak. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to establish the distribution of vitamin D intakes required to maintain serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations above proposed cutoffs (25, 30, 40, and 50 nmol/L) during winter in white males and females (14-18 y of age) in the United Kingdom (51\u00b0N). DESIGN: In a dose-response trial, 110 adolescents (aged 15.9 \u00b1 1.4 y; 43% males) were randomly assigned to receive 0, 10, or 20 \u03bcg vitamin D3 supplements/d for 20 wk during winter. A nonlinear regression model was fit to total vitamin D intake and postintervention serum 25(OH)D concentrations, and regression-predicted values estimated the vitamin D intakes required to maintain serum 25(OH)D concentrations above specific cutoffs. RESULTS: Mean \u00b1 SD serum 25(OH)D concentrations increased from 49.2 \u00b1 12.0 to 56.6 \u00b1 12.4 nmol/L and from 51.7 \u00b1 13.4 to 63.9 \u00b1 10.6 nmol/L in the 10- and 20-\u03bcg/d groups, respectively, and decreased in the placebo group from 46.8 \u00b1 11.4 to 30.7 \u00b1 8.6 nmol/L (all P \u2264 0.001). Vitamin D intakes required to maintain 25(OH)D concentrations >25 and >30 nmol/L in 97.5% of adolescents were estimated to be 10.1 and 13.1 \u03bcg/d, respectively, and 6.6 \u03bcg/d to maintain 50% of adolescents at concentrations >40 nmol/L. Because the response of 25(OH)D reached a plateau at 46 nmol/L, there is uncertainty in estimating the vitamin D intake required to maintain 25(OH)D concentrations >50 nmol/L in 97.5% of adolescents, but it exceeded 30 \u03bcg/d. CONCLUSION: Vitamin D intakes between 10 and \u223c30 \u03bcg/d are required by white adolescents during winter to maintain serum 25(OH)D concentrations >25-50 nmol/L, depending on the serum 25(OH)D threshold chosen.

Serum 25(OH)D was measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry at baseline and at weeks 6 and 12 of the study.Results: Postintervention in the 2 ethnic groups combined, both the vitamin D3 biscuit and the vitamin D3 juice groups showed a significantly greater absolute incremental change (\u0394) in total 25(OH)D when compared with the vitamin D2 biscuit group [\u0394 (95% CI): 15.3 nmol/L (7.4, 23.3 nmol/L) (P < 0.0003) and 16.0 nmol/L (8.0, 23.9 nmol/L) ( P < 0.0001)], the vitamin D2 juice group [\u0394 (95% CI): 16.3 nmol/L (8.4, 24.2 nmol/L) (P < 0.0001) and 16.9 nmol/L (9.0, 24.8 nmol/L) (P < 0.0001)], and the placebo group [\u0394 (95% CI): 42.3 nmol/L (34.4, 50.2 nmol/L) (P < 0.0001) and 42.9 nmol/L (35.0, 50.8 nmol/L) (P < 0.0002)].Conclusions: With the use of a daily dose of vitamin D relevant to public health recommendations (15 \u03bcg) and in vehicles relevant to food-fortification strategies, vitamin D3 was more effective than vitamin D2 in increasing serum 25(OH)D in the wintertime. Vitamin D3 may therefore be a preferential form to optimize vitamin D status within the general population. This trial was registered at www.controlled-trials.com as ISRCTN23421591.", "27445320": "Magnesium in pregnancy.\nMagnesium deficiency is prevalent in women of childbearing age in both developing and developed countries. The need for magnesium increases during pregnancy, and the majority of pregnant women likely do not meet this increased need. Magnesium deficiency or insufficiency during pregnancy may pose a health risk for both the mother and the newborn, with implications that may extend into adulthood of the offspring. The measurement of serum magnesium is the most widely used method for determining magnesium levels, but it has significant limitations that have both hindered the assessment of deficiency and affected the reliability of studies in pregnant women. Thus far, limited studies have suggested links between magnesium inadequacy and certain conditions in pregnancy associated with high mortality and morbidity, such as gestational diabetes, preterm labor, preeclampsia, and small for gestational age or intrauterine growth restriction. This review provides recommendations for further study and improved testing using measurement of red cell magnesium. Pregnant women should be counseled to increase their intake of magnesium-rich foods such as nuts, seeds, beans, and leafy greens and/or to supplement with magnesium at a safe level.", "28637772": "Tolerance to increased supplemented dietary intakes of methionine in healthy older adults.\nBackground: l-Methionine (Met) is an essential amino acid for humans and is important for protein synthesis and the formation of polyamines and is involved in the synthesis of many metabolites, including homocysteine. Free-Met supplements have been claimed to have multiple positive effects; however, it remains unclear what the exact tolerance level is. With aging, Met metabolism changes, and increased plasma homocysteine is more apparent. High plasma concentrations of homocysteine are assumed to be associated with a high risk of developing atherosclerosis.Objective: We estimated the no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) and the lowest-observed-adverse-effect level (LOAEL) of supplemented, oral, free Met in healthy older adults by examining the increase in plasma homocysteine as the primary determinant.Design: We provided capsules with free Met to 15 healthy older adult subjects for 4 wk at climbing dosages of, on average, 9.2, 22.5, 46.3 and 91 mg \u00b7 kg body weight-1 \u00b7 d-1 with washout periods of 2 wk between each intake. Before, at 2 and 4 wk during, and 2 wk after each dosage, we studied a complete panel of biochemical blood variables to detect possible intolerance to increased Met intake. Plasma homocysteine and body composition were measured, and tolerance, quality of life, and cognitive function were assessed via questionnaires.Results: Plasma homocysteine was elevated with the highest dose of supplemented Met. The estimated NOAEL of supplemented Met was set at 46.3 mg \u00b7 kg body weight-1 \u00b7 d-1, and the estimated LOAEL of supplemented Met was set at 91 mg \u00b7 kg body weight-1 \u00b7 d-1 (on the basis of the actual intakes) in subjects independent of sex. No signs of intolerance were observed via questionnaires or other blood variables at the LOAEL. There were no meaningful changes in body composition.Conclusions: On the basis of plasma homocysteine, the NOAEL of supplemented Met intake is 46.3 and the LOAEL is 91 mg \u00b7 kg body weight-1 \u00b7 d-1 in healthy older adults. Both the NOAEL and LOAEL are not associated with meaningful effects on health and wellbeing.

OBJECTIVE: We performed a meta-analysis to investigate the correlations between calcium supplementation and changes in body weight on the basis of age, sex, body mass index (BMI) of the subjects, and length of calcium intervention. DESIGN: PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Knowledge, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases were systematically searched to select relevant studies that were published from January 1994 to March 2016. Both randomized controlled trials and longitudinal studies of calcium supplementation were included, and random- or fixed-effects models in a software program were used for the data analysis. RESULTS: Thirty-three studies involving a total of 4733 participants were included in this meta-analysis. No significant differences in weight changes were shown between calcium intervention and control groups (mean: -0.01 kg; 95% CI -0.02, 0.00 kg; P = 0.12). However, negative correlations between calcium supplementation and weight changes were shown in children and adolescents (mean: -0.26 kg; 95% CI: -0.41, -0.11 kg; P < 0.001) and in adult men and either premenopausal or old (>60 y of age) women (mean: -0.91 kg; 95% CI: -1.38, -0.44 kg; P < 0.001) but not in postmenopausal women (mean: -0.14 kg; 95% CI: -0.54, 0.26 kg; P = 0.50). When BMI was considered, a negative correlation between calcium supplementation and weight changes was observed in subjects with normal BMI (mean: -0.53 kg; 95% CI: -0.89, -0.16 kg; P = 0.005) but not in overweight or obese subjects (mean: -0.35 kg; 95% CI: -0.81, 0.11 kg; P = 0.14). Compared with the control groups, no differences in weight changes were shown in the calcium-intervention groups when the lengths of calcium interventions were <6 mo (mean: -0.09 kg; 95% CI: -0.45, 0.26 kg; P = 0.60) or \u22656 mo (mean: -0.01 kg; 95% CI: -0.02, 0.01 kg; P = 0.46).

Micronutrient supplements have the potential to improve child growth. OBJECTIVE: We assessed the effect of daily zinc, multivitamin (vitamins C, E, and B-complex), and zinc and multivitamin (Zn+MV) supplementation on growth in infants in Tanzania. DESIGN: In this randomized, 2 \u00d7 2 factorial, double-blind trial, 2400 infants were randomly assigned to receive zinc, multivitamins, Zn+MVs, or a placebo at 6 wk of age and were followed up for 18 mo with monthly growth measurements. Mixed-effects models with restricted cubic splines for the mean change in anthropometric z scores were fit for each group. Likelihood ratio tests were used to compare the effect of supplements on growth trajectories. Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare incidences of stunting, wasting, and underweight. RESULTS: Children in all groups experienced growth faltering. At 19 mo of age, prevalences of stunting, wasting, and underweight were 19.8%, 6.0%, and 10.8%, respectively. Changes in weight-for-age z scores (WAZs) and weight-for-height z scores (WHZs) were significantly different across the 4 groups (P < 0.001 for both). The mean \u00b1 SE decline in the WAZ from baseline to the end of follow-up in the Zn+MV group was significantly less than in the placebo group (-0.36 \u00b1 0.04 compared with -0.50 \u00b1 0.04; P = 0.020), whereas the decline in the WHZ was significantly greater in the zinc-only group than in the placebo group (-0.57 \u00b1 0.07 compared with -0.35 \u00b1 0.07; P = 0.021). Supplements did not have a significant effect on mean change in the height-for-age z score or on rates of stunting, wasting, or underweight. CONCLUSIONS: Although there were small but significant improvements in the WAZ in the Zn+MV group, daily zinc supplementation alone, multivitamin supplementation alone, and the combined Zn+MV did not reduce the incidences of underweight, stunting, or wasting in Tanzanian infants. Alternative approaches to prevent growth faltering should be pursued.

OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to determine whether provision of small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplements (SQ-LNSs) to mothers during pregnancy and the first 6 mo postpartum, and to children aged 6-18 mo, improves infant development in Malawi. DESIGN: We randomly assigned 869 pregnant women to receive one of the following daily: an iron and folic acid (IFA) capsule, a multiple micronutrient (MMN) capsule containing 18 micronutrients, or a 20-g sachet of SQ-LNSs containing 22 vitamins and minerals, protein, carbohydrates, essential fatty acids, and 118 kcal. Children in the lipid-based nutrient supplement (LNS) group only received SQ-LNSs from 6 to 18 mo of age. We monitored the acquisition of 11 developmental milestones monthly by maternal report; observed the attainment of 7 motor milestones at 6, 12, and 18 mo of age; and conducted a comprehensive assessment of motor, language, and socioemotional development and executive function at 18 mo of age. The primary analysis was by intention-to-treat. RESULTS: By maternal report, children in the LNS group achieved walking alone (B = 0.53; 95% CI: 0.11, 0.94; P = 0.034) and waving goodbye (B = 0.60; 95% CI: 0.12, 1.08; P = 0.040) earlier than the IFA group and standing with assistance earlier than the MMN group (B = 0.51; 95% CI: 0.12, 0.89; P = 0.029). By researcher observation, there was a trend (P = 0.052) for a greater percentage of children in the LNS group (58%) to walk alone at age 12 mo than in the IFA (49%) and MMN (49%) groups. At age 18 mo, there were no significant differences between groups in any scores. CONCLUSION: Although provision of SQ-LNSs to pregnant women and infants in Malawi may affect the age of acquisition of certain developmental milestones, it did not affect our assessments of motor, language, socioemotional, or executive function skills at 18 mo of age.

Few large-scale studies have considered both food sources and supplements in assessing the adequacy of nutritional intakes during pregnancy.Objective: Our study aimed to assess nutritional intakes during pregnancy by examining dietary sources and supplements. It then compared these findings with Dietary Reference Intakes.Design: We conducted a nutrition study in a large pregnancy cohort using a 3-d food record during the second trimester of pregnancy. Detailed information about supplement consumption was obtained by interview at each prenatal visit. We estimated the distribution of total usual intakes for energy, macronutrients, and micronutrients for 1533 pregnant women.Results: A third of the participants had total fat intakes that exceeded the Acceptable Micronutrient Distribution Range. A majority of women (85%) had sodium intakes above the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL). Median intakes for fiber and potassium were lower than Adequate Intakes. Dietary intakes of vitamin B-6, magnesium, and zinc were below the Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) for 10-15% of the women. A majority of the women had dietary intakes below the EARs for iron (97%), vitamin D (96%), and folate (70%). When we considered micronutrient intakes from both food and supplements, we found that the prevalence of inadequate intake was <10% for all nutrients except vitamin D (18%) and iron (15%), whereas 32% and 87% of the women had total intakes above the ULs for iron and folic acid, respectively.Conclusions: The level of intake of some nutrients from food alone remains low in the diets of pregnant women. Supplement use reduces the risk of inadequate intake for many micronutrients, but diet-related issues during pregnancy remain and deserve to be addressed in public health interventions.

Cysteinylglycine is a pro-oxidant metabolite of glutathione and a precursor of cysteine. OBJECTIVE: To examine the relation between serum cysteine and cysteinylglycine and risk of gastric adenocarcinomas, esophageal squamous cell carcinomas, and head and neck squamous cell carcinomas, we conducted a nested case-control study within the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention study of male Finnish smokers aged 50-69 y at baseline. DESIGN: In total, 170 gastric adenocarcinomas, 68 esophageal squamous cell carcinomas, and 270 head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (identified from the Finnish Cancer Registry) were matched one-to-one with cancer-free control subjects on age and the date of serum collection. We calculated ORs and 95% CIs with the use of a multivariate-adjusted conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: Cysteine had a U-shaped association with gastric adenocarcinomas; a model that included a linear and a squared term had a significant global P-test (P = 0.036). Serum cysteinylglycine was inversely associated with adenocarcinomas of the gastric cardia (OR for above the median compared with below the median: 0.07; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.70; n = 38 cases) but not for other sites. Both cysteine and cysteinylglycine were not associated with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma or head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.

Multiple studies investigating AMD with the use of animal models and cell culture have identified oxidative stress-related retinal damage as an important contributing factor. In general, diet is an excellent source of the antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals necessary for healthy living; moreover, the general public is often receptive to recommendations made by physicians and health care workers regarding diet and supplements as a means of empowering themselves to avoid common and worrisome ailments such as AMD, which has made epidemiologists and clinicians enthusiastic about dietary intervention studies. A wide variety of nutrients, such as minerals, vitamins, \u03c9-3 (n-3) fatty acids, and various carotenoids, have been associated with reducing the risk of AMD. Initial results from the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) indicated that supplementation with antioxidants (\u03b2-carotene and vitamins C and E) and zinc was associated with a reduced risk of AMD progression. The AREDS2 follow-up study, designed to improve upon the earlier formulation, tested the addition of lutein, zeaxanthin, and \u03c9-3 fatty acids. In this review, we examine the science behind the nutritional factors included in these interventional studies and the reasons for considering their inclusion to lower the rate of AMD progression.", "28659293": "Lower systolic blood pressure at age 7 y in low-birth-weight children who received iron supplements in infancy: results from a randomized controlled trial.\nBackground: Low birth weight (LBW) (\u22642500 g) is associated with iron deficiency in infancy and high blood pressure (BP) later in life.Objective: We investigated the effect of iron supplementation that was given to LBW infants on midchildhood BP.Design: The study was a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial that included 285 marginally LBW (2000-2500-g) infants at 2 Swedish centers between May 2004 and November 2007. The infants were randomly assigned to receive a placebo or 1 or 2 mg Fe \u00b7 kg-1 \u00b7 d-1 from 6 wk to 6 mo of age. In secondary analyses at the age of 7 y, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and the prevalence of children with BP within the hypertensive range (>90th percentile) were compared between the groups.Results: BP was analyzed via intention to treat in 189 children (66%). The mean \u00b1 SD SBP was 103 \u00b1 8.1, 101 \u00b1 7.5, and 101 \u00b1 7.8 mm Hg in children who had received the placebo (n = 70), 1 mg Fe \u00b7 kg-1 \u00b7 d-1 (n = 54), or 2 mg Fe \u00b7 kg-1 \u00b7 d-1 (n = 65), respectively. When the iron-supplemented groups were combined in covariate-adjusted analyses, the mean SBP in LBW children who had received iron supplementation in infancy was 2.2 mm Hg (95% CI: 0.3, 4.2 mm Hg) lower than in those who were unsupplemented (P = 0.026). Multivariate logistic regression showed that iron supplementation in infancy reduced the odds of having an SBP within the hypertensive range at 7 y of age (OR: 0.32; 95% CI: 0.11, 0.96). For DBP, there were no significant differences between the intervention groups.Conclusions: LBW children who receive iron supplementation (1 or 2 mg Fe \u00b7 kg-1 \u00b7 d-1) in infancy have lower SBP at 7 y. This (to our knowledge) novel observation suggests that the increased risk of hypertension that is observed in children and adults who are born small might be reduced with early micronutrient interventions.

More than 50% of all injuries in sports can be classified as sprains, strains, ruptures, or breaks of musculoskeletal tissues. Nutritional and/or exercise interventions that increase collagen synthesis and strengthen these tissues could have an important effect on injury rates. OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to determine whether gelatin supplementation could increase collagen synthesis. DESIGN: Eight healthy male subjects completed a randomized, double-blinded, crossover-design study in which they consumed either 5 or 15 g of vitamin C-enriched gelatin or a placebo control. After the initial drink, blood was taken every 30 min to determine amino acid content in the blood. A larger blood sample was taken before and 1 h after consumption of gelatin for treatment of engineered ligaments. One hour after the initial supplement, the subjects completed 6 min of rope-skipping to stimulate collagen synthesis. This pattern of supplementation was repeated 3 times/d with \u22656 h between exercise bouts for 3 d. Blood was drawn before and 4, 24, 48, and 72 h after the first exercise bout for determination of amino-terminal propeptide of collagen I content. RESULTS: Supplementation with increasing amounts of gelatin increased circulating glycine, proline, hydroxyproline, and hydroxylysine, peaking 1 h after the supplement was given. Engineered ligaments treated for 6 d with serum from samples collected before or 1 h after subjects consumed a placebo or 5 or 15 g gelatin showed increased collagen content and improved mechanics. Subjects who took 15 g gelatin 1 h before exercise showed double the amino-terminal propeptide of collagen I in their blood, indicating increased collagen synthesis. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that adding gelatin to an intermittent exercise program improves collagen synthesis and could play a beneficial role in injury prevention and tissue repair.

Because thyroid hormone synthesis is affected by iodine deficiency on the one hand and by excess iodine intake on the other, thyroid function biomarkers may be useful for assessing iodine status and studying the effects of iodine supplementation. However, reference intervals for some of the most useful thyroid function biomarkers, including serum concentrations of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (FT4), and thyroglobulin, vary widely due to variability in the commercially available immunoassays for these tests. Recognizing the need for standardization of thyroid function testing, the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine established a working group, later restructured as the Committee for Standardization of Thyroid Function Tests, to examine its feasibility. The committee has established a conventional reference measurement procedure for FT4 and an approach to harmonization of results for TSH. Panels of single-donation human blood specimens that span the measuring interval of the immunoassays were used to assess the performance of commercially available immunoassays and form the basis for their recalibration. Recalibration of the manufacturers' methods for both FT4 and TSH has shown that the variability among immunoassays can be successfully eliminated for euthyroid individuals as well as for patients with thyroid disease. The committee is not investigating the standardization of thyroglobulin at the present time.", "27534645": "Vitamin B-12 status and neurologic function in older people: a cross-sectional analysis of baseline trial data from the Older People and Enhanced Neurological Function (OPEN) study.\nBACKGROUND: Aging is associated with a progressive decline in vitamin B-12 status. Overt vitamin B-12 deficiency causes neurologic disturbances in peripheral and central motor and sensory systems, but the public health impact for neurologic disease of moderately low vitamin B-12 status in older people is unclear. Evidence from observational studies is limited by heterogeneity in the definition of vitamin B-12 status and imprecise measures of nerve function. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine whether vitamin B-12 status is associated with electrophysiologic indexes of peripheral or central neurologic function in asymptomatic older people with moderately low vitamin B-12 status. DESIGN: We used a cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from the Older People and Enhanced Neurological Function study conducted in Southeast England. This trial investigated the effectiveness of vitamin B-12 supplementation on electrophysiologic indexes of neurologic function in asymptomatic older people (mean age: 80 y) with moderately low vitamin B-12 status (serum vitamin B-12 concentrations \u2265107 and <210 pmol/L without anemia, n = 201). Vitamin B-12 status was assessed with the use of total vitamin B-12, holotranscobalamin, and a composite indicator of vitamin B-12 status (cB-12). Electrophysiologic measures of sensory and motor components of peripheral and central nerve function were assessed in all participants by a single observer. RESULTS: In multivariate models, there was no evidence of an association of vitamin B-12, holotranscobalamin, or cB-12 with any nerve conduction outcome. There was also no evidence of an association of vitamin B-12 status with clinical markers of neurologic function. CONCLUSION: This secondary analysis of high-quality trial data did not show any association of any measure of vitamin B-12 status with either peripheral or central neurologic function or any clinical markers of neurologic function in older people with moderately low vitamin B-12 status. The results of this study are unlikely to be generalizable to a less healthy older population with more severe vitamin B-12 deficiency.

Only a few prospective studies have investigated the role of dairy consumption in both weight change and risk of becoming overweight or obese and whether these associations depend on the initial body weight. OBJECTIVE: We prospectively investigated how dairy product intake was associated with weight change and risk of becoming overweight or obese in initially normal-weight women. DESIGN: We studied 18,438 women aged \u226545 y from the Women's Health Study who were free of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes and had initial body mass index (BMI; in kg/m(2)) from 18.5 to <25 at baseline. Dairy intake was assessed with the use of a 131-item food-frequency questionnaire. Women self-reported body weight along with obesity-related risk factors on baseline and annual follow-up questionnaires. At each follow-up time, women were categorized as normal weight (BMI: 18.5 to <25), overweight (BMI: 25 to <30), or obese (BMI \u226530). RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 11.2 y, 8238 women became overweight or obese. Multivariable-adjusted mean \u00b1 SD changes in body weight during the follow-up (18 y) were 1.90 \u00b1 0.09, 1.88 \u00b1 0.08, 1.86 \u00b1 0.09, 1.82 \u00b1 0.09, and 1.65 \u00b1 0.09 kg in quintiles 1-5 of total dairy intake, respectively (P-trend = 0.003). Greater intake of high-fat dairy products, but not intake of low-fat dairy products, was associated with less weight gain (P-trend = 0.004). In multivariable-adjusted analyses, lower risk of becoming overweight or obese was observed in the highest quintile of high-fat dairy product intake (HR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.86, 0.99). Dietary or supplemental calcium or vitamin D was not associated with risk of becoming overweight or obese. CONCLUSION: Greater consumption of total dairy products may be of importance in the prevention of weight gain in middle-aged and elderly women who are initially normal weight.", "26912491": "Maternal single nucleotide polymorphisms in the fatty acid desaturase 1 and 2 coding regions modify the impact of prenatal supplementation with DHA on birth weight.\nBACKGROUND: Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the fatty acid desaturase (FADS) gene affect the activity and efficiency of enzymes that are responsible for the conversion of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) into their long-chain active form. A high prevalence of SNPs that are associated with slow PUFA conversion has been described in Hispanic populations. OBJECTIVE: We assessed the heterogeneity of the effect of prenatal supplementation with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on birth weight across selected FADS SNPs in a sample of Mexican women and their offspring. DESIGN: We obtained information on the maternal genotype from stored blood samples of 654 women who received supplementation with 400 mg DHA/d or a placebo from weeks 18 to 22 of gestation through delivery as part of a randomized controlled trial conducted in Cuernavaca, Mexico. We selected 4 tag SNPs (rs174455, rs174556, rs174602, and rs498793) in the FADS region for analysis. We used an ANOVA to test for the heterogeneity of the effect on birth weight across each of the 4 SNPs. RESULTS: The mean \u00b1 SD birth weight was 3210 \u00b1 470 g, and the weight-for-age z score (WAZ) was -0.24 \u00b1 1.00. There were no intention-to-treat differences in birth weights. We showed significant heterogeneity by SNP rs174602 (P= 0.02); offspring of carriers of alleles TT and TC in the intervention group were heavier than those in the placebo group (WAZ: -0.13 \u00b1 0.14 and -0.20 \u00b1 0.08 compared with -0.55 \u00b1 0.15 and -0.39 \u00b1 0.09, respectively); there were no significant differences in offspring of rs174602 CC homozygotes (WAZ: -0.26 \u00b1 0.09 in the intervention group compared with -0.04 \u00b1 0.09 in the placebo group). We showed no significant heterogeneity across the other 3 FADS SNPs. CONCLUSION: Differential responses to prenatal DHA supplementation on the basis of the genetic makeup of target populations could explain the mixed evidence of the impact of DHA supplementation on birth weight.

Although cross-sectional and retrospective data support favorable associations between the equol producer (EP) phenotype and cardiometabolic health, few studies have prospectively recruited EPs to confirm this association. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to determine whether the acute vascular benefits of isoflavones differ according to EP phenotype and subsequently investigate the effect of providing commercially produced S-(-)equol to non-EPs. DESIGN: We prospectively recruited male EPs and non-EPs (n = 14/group) at moderate cardiovascular risk into a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study to examine the acute effects of soy isoflavones (80-mg aglycone equivalents) on arterial stiffness [carotid-femoral pulse-wave velocity (cfPWV)], blood pressure, endothelial function (measured by using the EndoPAT 2000; Itamar Medical), and nitric oxide at baseline (0 h) and 6 and 24 h after intake. In a separate assessment, non-EPs consumed 40 mg S-(-)equol with identical vascular measurements performed 2 h after intake. RESULTS: After soy intake, cfPWV significantly improved in EPs at 24 h (cfPWV change from 0 h: isoflavone, -0.2 \u00b1 0.2 m/s; placebo, 0.6 \u00b1 0.2 m/s; P < 0.01), which was significantly associated with plasma equol concentrations (R = -0.36, P = 0.01). No vascular effects were observed in EPs at 6 h or in non-EPs at any time point. Similarly, no benefit of commercially produced S-(-)equol was observed in non-EPs despite mean plasma equol concentrations reaching 3.2 \u03bcmol/L. CONCLUSIONS: Acute soy intake improved cfPWV in EPs, equating to an 11-12% reduced risk of cardiovascular disease if sustained. However, a single dose of commercially produced equol had no cardiovascular benefits in non-EPs. These data suggest that the EP phenotype is critical in unlocking the vascular benefits of equol in men, and long-term trials should focus on confirming the implications of EP phenotype on cardiovascular health.

T cell function declines with age. Zinc supplementation has the potential to improve the serum zinc concentrations and immunity of nursing home elderly with a low serum zinc concentration. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine the effect of supplementation with 30 mg Zn/d for 3 mo on serum zinc concentrations of zinc-deficient nursing home elderly. DESIGN: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Of 53 nursing home elderly (aged \u226565 y) who met eligibility criteria, 58% had a low serum zinc concentration (serum zinc <70 \u03bcg/dL); these 31 were randomly assigned to zinc (30 mg Zn/d) (n = 16) or placebo (5 mg Zn/d) (n = 15) groups. The primary outcome measure was change in serum zinc concentrations between baseline and month 3. We also explored the effects of supplementation on immune response. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were similar in the 2 groups. The difference in the mean change in serum zinc was significantly higher, by 16%, in the zinc group than in the placebo group (P = 0.007) when baseline zinc concentrations were controlled for. In addition, controlling for baseline C-reactive protein, copper, or albumin did not change the results. However, supplementation of participants with \u226460 \u03bcg serum Zn/dL failed to increase their serum zinc to \u226570 \u03bcg/dL. Zinc supplementation also significantly increased anti-CD3/CD28 and phytohemagglutinin-stimulated T cell proliferation, and the number of peripheral T cells (P < 0.05). When proliferation was expressed per number of T cells, the significant differences between groups were lost, suggesting that the zinc-induced enhancement of T cell proliferation was mainly due to an increase in the number of T cells. CONCLUSIONS: Zinc supplementation at 30 mg/d for 3 mo is effective in increasing serum zinc concentrations in nursing home elderly; however, not all zinc-deficient elderly reached adequate concentrations. The increase in serum zinc concentration was associated with the enhancement of T cell function mainly because of an increase in the number of T cells.", "26843153": "Comparison of iron status 28 d after provision of antimalarial treatment with iron therapy compared with antimalarial treatment alone in Ugandan children with severe malaria.\nBACKGROUND: The provision of iron with antimalarial treatment is the standard of care for concurrent iron deficiency and malaria. However, iron that is given during a malaria episode may not be well absorbed or used, particularly in children with severe malaria and profound inflammation. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to 1) determine baseline values of iron and inflammatory markers in children with severe malarial anemia (SMA), children with cerebral malaria (CM), and community children (CC) and 2) compare markers in iron-deficient children in each group who received 28 d of iron supplementation during antimalarial treatment with those in children who did not receive iron during treatment.. DESIGN: Seventy-nine children with CM, 77 children with SMA, and 83 CC who presented to Mulago Hospital, Kampala, Uganda, were enrolled in a 28-d iron-therapy study. Children with malaria received antimalarial treatment. All children with CM or SMA, as well as 35 CC, had zinc protoporphyrin (ZPP) concentrations \u226580 \u03bcmol/mol heme and were randomly assigned to receive a 28-d course of iron or no iron. We compared iron markers at day 0 among study groups (CM, SMA, and CC groups) and at day 28 between children in each group who were randomly assigned to receive iron or to not receive iron. RESULTS: At day 0, children with CM and SMA had greater values of C-reactive protein, ferritin, and hepcidin than those of CC. At day 28, interactions between study and treatment group were NS. Children in the no-iron compared with iron groups had similar mean values for hemoglobin (115 compared with 113 g/L, respectively; P = 0.73) and ZPP (124 compared with 124 \u03bcmol/mol heme, respectively; P = 0.96) but had lower median ferritin [101.0 \u03bcg/L (95% CI: 84.2, 121.0 \u03bcg/L) compared with 152.9 \u03bcg/L (128.8, 181.6 \u03bcg/L), respectively; P \u2264 0.001] and hepcidin [45.8 ng/mL (36.8, 56.9 ng/mL) compared with 83.1 ng/mL (67.6, 102.2 ng/mL), respectively; P < 0.011]. CONCLUSIONS: Severe inflammation is a characterization of children with CM and SMA. The withholding of iron from children with severe malaria is associated with lower ferritin and hepcidin at day 28 but not a lower hemoglobin concentration.

We conducted a systematic review, meta-analysis, and subgroup analysis of findings from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to assess the magnitude of the effect of the probiotics on health outcomes among very-low-birth-weight (VLBW) infants. Relevant articles from January 2003 to June 2017 were selected from a broad range of databases, including Medline, PubMed, Scopus, and Embase. Studies were included if they used an RCT design, involved a VLBW infant (birthweight <1500 g or gestational age <32 wk) population, included a probiotic intervention group, measured necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) as a primary outcome, and measured sepsis, mortality, length of hospital stay, weight gain, and intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) as additional outcomes. The initial database search yielded 132 potentially relevant articles and 32 (n = 8998 infants) RCTs were included in the final meta-analysis. Subgroup analysis was used to evaluate the effects of the moderators on the outcome variables. In the probiotics group, it was found that NEC was reduced by 37% (95% CI: 0.51%, 0.78%), sepsis by 37% (95% CI: 0.72%, 0.97%), mortality by 20% (95% CI: 0.67%, 0.95%), and length of hospital stay by 3.77 d (95% CI: -5.94, -1.60 d). These findings were all significant when compared with the control group. There was inconsistent use of strain types among some of the studies. The results indicate that probiotic consumption can significantly reduce the risk of developing medical complications associated with NEC and sepsis, reduce mortality and length of hospital stay, and promote weight gain in VLBW infants. Probiotics are more effective when taken in breast milk and formula form, consumed for <6 wk, administered with a dosage of <109 CFU/d, and include multiple strains. Probiotics are not effective in reducing the incidence of IVH in VLBW infants.", "26762369": "Long-term risk of type 2 diabetes in relation to habitual iron intake in women with a history of gestational diabetes: a prospective cohort study.\nBACKGROUND: An iron overload may induce pancreatic islet damage and increase risk of diabetes. Women with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) after pregnancy. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine the association of habitual iron intake with long-term risk of T2DM in this high-risk population. DESIGN: We included 3976 women with a history of GDM from the Nurses' Health Study II cohort as part of the ongoing Diabetes & Women's Health Study. The women were followed up through 2009. Iron intake was assessed with the use of a validated food-frequency questionnaire in 1991 and every 4 y thereafter. We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate HRs and 95% CIs. RESULTS: We documented 641 incident T2DM cases during 57,683 person-years of observation. Adjusted HRs for T2DM for the highest quartile compared with the lowest quartile were 1.64 (95% CI: 1.20, 2.25; P-trend = 0.02) for total iron intake and 1.80 (95% CI: 1.18, 2.74; P-trend = 0.005) for dietary heme iron intake. In addition, women who consumed \u226530.0 mg supplemental Fe/d, compared with nonusers, had an adjusted HR of 1.83 (95% CI: 1.25, 2.70; P-trend = 0.002). CONCLUSION: In women with a history of GDM, greater intakes of total iron, dietary heme iron, and supplemental iron were associated with higher risk of T2DM.", "28679554": "Protein supplements after weight loss do not improve weight maintenance compared with recommended dietary protein intake despite beneficial effects on appetite sensation and energy expenditure: a randomized, controlled, double-blinded trial.\nBackground: High-protein diets increase weight loss (WL) during energy restriction; therefore, it has been suggested that additional protein intake may improve weight maintenance (WM) after WL.Objective: We investigated the effect of protein supplements from either whey with or without calcium or soy on WM success after WL compared with that of a control.Design: In a randomized, controlled, double-blinded trial, 220 participants aged 18-60 y with body mass index (in kg/m2) from 27.6 to 40.4 were included. The study was initiated with an 8-wk WL period followed by a 24-wk WM period. During WM, participants consumed the following isocaloric supplements (45-48 g/d): whey and calcium (whey+), whey, soy, or maltodextrin (control). Data were collected at baseline, before WM, and after WM (weeks 0, 8, and 32, respectively) and included body composition, blood biochemistry, and blood pressure. Meal tests were performed to investigate diet-induced-thermogenesis (DIT) and appetite sensation. Compliance was tested by 24-h urinary nitrogen excretion.Results: A total of 151 participants completed the WM period. The control and 3 protein supplements did not result in different mean \u00b1 SD weight regains (whey+: 2.19 \u00b1 4.6 kg; whey: 2.01 \u00b1 4.6 kg; soy: 1.76 \u00b1 4.7 kg; and control: 2.23 \u00b1 3.8 kg; P = 0.96), fat mass regains (whey+: 0.46 \u00b1 4.5 kg; whey: 0.11 \u00b1 4.1 kg; soy: 0.15 \u00b1 4.1 kg; and control: 0.54 \u00b1 3.3 kg; P = 0.96), or improvements in lean body mass (whey+: 1.87 \u00b1 1.7 kg; whey: 1.94 \u00b1 1.3 kg; soy: 1.58 \u00b1 1.4 kg; and control: 1.74 \u00b1 1.4 kg; P = 0.50) during WM. Changes in blood pressure and blood biochemistry were not different between groups. Compared with the control, protein supplementation resulted in higher DIT (\u223c30 kJ/2.5 h) and resting energy expenditure (243 kJ/d) and an anorexigenic appetite-sensation profile.Conclusion: Protein supplementation does not result in improved WM success, or blood biochemistry after WL compared with the effects of normal dietary protein intake (0.8-1.0 g \u00b7 kg-1 \u00b7 d-1).

First, strategies for point-of-manufacture chemical fortification are compared with biofortification achieved through plant breeding. Recent insights into the mechanisms of human iron absorption and regulation, the mechanisms by which iron can promote malaria and bacterial infections, and the role of iron in modifying the gut microbiota are summarized. There is strong evidence that supplemental iron given in nonphysiological amounts can increase the risk of bacterial and protozoal infections (especially malaria), but the use of lower quantities of iron provided within a food matrix, ie, fortified food, should be safer in most cases and represents a more logical strategy for a sustained reduction of the risk of deficiency by providing the best balance of risk and benefits. Further research into iron compounds that would minimize the availability of unabsorbed iron to the gut microbiota is warranted.", "26961929": "Effect of \u03c9-3 supplementation on placental lipid metabolism in overweight and obese women.\nBACKGROUND: The placentas of obese women accumulate lipids that may alter fetal lipid exposure. The long-chain omega-3 fatty acids (n\u20133 FAs) docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) alter FA metabolism in hepatocytes, although their effect on the placenta is poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate whether n\u20133 supplementation during pregnancy affects lipid metabolism in the placentas of overweight and obese women at term. DESIGN: A secondary analysis of a double-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted in healthy overweight and obese pregnant women who were randomly assigned to DHA plus EPA (2 g/d) or placebo twice a day from early pregnancy to term. Placental FA uptake, esterification, and oxidation pathways were studied by measuring the expression of key genes in the placental tissue of women supplemented with placebo and n\u20133 and in vitro in isolated trophoblast cells in response to DHA and EPA treatment. RESULTS: Total lipid content was significantly lower in the placentas of overweight and obese women supplemented with n\u20133 FAs than in those supplemented with placebo (14.14 \u00b1 1.03 compared with 19.63 \u00b1 1.45 mg lipid/g tissue; P < 0.05). The messenger RNA expression of placental FA synthase (FAS) and diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1) was negatively correlated with maternal plasma enrichment in DHA and EPA (P < 0.05). The expression of placental peroxisome proliferator\u2013activated receptor \u03b3 (r = \u22120.39, P = 0.04) and its target genes DGAT1 (r = \u22120.37, P = 0.02) and PLIN2 (r = \u22120.38, P = 0.04) significantly decreased, with an increasing maternal n\u20133:n\u20136 ratio (representing the n\u20133 status) near the end of pregnancy. The expression of genes that regulate FA oxidation or uptake was not changed. Birth weight and length were significantly higher in the offspring of n\u20133-supplemented women than in those in the placebo group (P < 0.05), but no differences in the ponderal index were observed.

It is crucial to identify probiotic bacteria that have increased stress tolerance to survive during production, processing, and storage of food products. However, in order to achieve high resistance to environmental factors, there is a need to better understand stress-induced responses and adaptive mechanisms. With advances in bacterial genomics, there has been an upsurge in the application of other omic platforms such as transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and some more recent ones such as interactomics, fluxomics, and phenomics. These omic technologies have revolutionized the functional genomics and their application. There have been several studies implementing various omic technologies to investigate the stress responses of probiotic bacteria. Integrated omics has the potential to provide in-depth information about the mechanisms of stress-induced responses in bacteria. However, there remain challenges in integrating information from different omic platforms. This review discusses current omic techniques and challenges faced in integrating various omic platforms with focus on their use in stress-response studies.", "28298275": "The Impact of Nutritional Interventions beyond the First 2 Years of Life on Linear Growth: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.\nA large body of evidence suggests that the first 1000 d from conception is a critical window in which interventions to address malnutrition will be most effective, but little is known about the impact on linear growth of nutritional interventions in children \u22652 y of age. The aim of this analysis was to evaluate the effectiveness of several nutrition-based interventions, specifically iron, zinc, calcium, iodine, vitamin A, multiple (\u22652) micronutrients, protein, and food, at improving growth in children \u22652 y of age. A systematic search of MEDLINE and EMBASE retrieved 7794 articles. A total of 69 studies met prespecified inclusion criteria. Baseline height-for-age z score, age, nutrient dose, and study duration were examined as potential sources of heterogeneity. Zinc (mean effect size: 0.15; 95% CI: 0.06, 0.24), vitamin A (0.05; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.09), multiple micronutrients (0.26; 95% CI: 0.13, 0.39), and protein (0.68; 95% CI: 0.30, 1.05) had significant positive effects on linear growth, with baseline height-for-age z score as a significant inverse predictor of the effect size. Iron, calcium, iodine, and food-based interventions had no significant effect on growth. Age at baseline, study duration, and dose were not related to effect size for any nutrient examined. These findings suggest that zinc, vitamin A, multiple micronutrients, and protein interventions delivered after 24 mo of age can have a positive effect on linear growth, especially in populations that have experienced growth failure.", "28490515": "The effect of oral iron with or without multiple micronutrients on hemoglobin concentration and hemoglobin response among nonpregnant Cambodian women of reproductive age: a 2 x 2 factorial, double-blind, randomized controlled supplementation trial.\nBackground: Despite a high prevalence of anemia among nonpregnant Cambodian women, current reports suggest that iron deficiency (ID) prevalence is low. If true, iron supplementation will not be an effective anemia reduction strategy.Objective: We measured the effect of daily oral iron with or without multiple micronutrients (MMNs) on hemoglobin concentration in nonpregnant Cambodian women screened as anemic.Design: In this 2 \u00d7 2 factorial, double-blind, randomized trial, nonpregnant women (aged 18-45 y) with hemoglobin concentrations \u2264117 g/L (capillary blood) were recruited from 26 villages in Kampong Chhnang province and randomly assigned to receive 12 wk of iron (60 mg; Fe group), MMNs (14 other micronutrients; MMN group), iron plus MMNs (Fe+MMN group), or placebo capsules. A 2 \u00d7 2 factorial intention-to-treat analysis with the use of a generalized mixed-effects model was used to assess the effects of iron and MMNs and the interaction between these factors. Results: In July 2015, 809 women were recruited and 760 (94%) completed the trial. Baseline anemia prevalence was 58% (venous blood). Mean (95% CI) hemoglobin concentrations at 12 wk in the Fe, MMN, Fe+MMN, and placebo groups were 121 (120, 121), 116 (116, 117), 123 (122, 123), and 116 (116, 117) g/L, with no iron \u00d7 MMN interaction (P = 0.66). Mean (95% CI) increases in hemoglobin were 5.6 g/L (3.8, 7.4 g/L) (P < 0.001) among women who received iron (n = 407) and 1.2 g/L (-0.6, 3.0 g/L) (P = 0.18) among women who received MMNs (n = 407). The predicted proportions (95% CIs) of women with a hemoglobin response (\u226510 g/L at 12 wk) were 19% (14%, 24%), 9% (5%, 12%), 30% (24%, 35%), and 5% (2%, 9%) in the Fe, MMN, Fe+MMN, and placebo groups, respectively.Conclusions: Daily iron supplementation for 12 wk increased hemoglobin in nonpregnant Cambodian women; however, MMNs did not confer additional significant benefit. Overall, \u223c24% of women who received iron responded after 12 wk; even fewer would be likely to respond in the wider population.

We reviewed the amounts, forms, and nutritional support (structure/function) claims of DSs that contain CS plants listed in the Dietary Supplement Label Database (DSLD) and compared this label information with trial doses and health endpoints for CS plants that were the subject of clinical trials listed in clinicaltrials.gov. According to the DSLD, the CS plants occurring most frequently in DSs were cayenne, cinnamon, garlic, ginger, pepper, rosemary, and turmeric. Identifying the botanical species, categorizing the forms used, and determining the amounts from the information provided on DS labels was challenging. CS plants were typically added as a component of a blend, as the powered biomass, dried extracts, and isolated phytochemicals. The amounts added were declared on about 55% of the labels, rendering it difficult to determine the amount of the CS plant used in many DSs. Clinicaltrials.gov provided little information about the composition of test articles in the intervention studies. When plant names were listed on DS labels and in clinical trials, generally the common name and not the Latin binomial name was given. In order to arrive at exposure estimates and enable researchers to reproduce clinical trials, the Latin binomial name, form, and amount of the CS plant used in DSs and tested in clinical trials must be specified.", "26980810": "Calcium Supplementation to Prevent Preeclampsia: Translating Guidelines into Practice in Low-Income Countries.\nThe WHO issued a strong recommendation that pregnant women be provided calcium supplements to prevent preeclampsia. This is the first recommended nutritional intervention to prevent this condition, a leading cause of maternal mortality globally. As health systems seek to implement this new intervention, a number of issues require further clarification and guidance, including dosage regimen, supplement formulation, and alignment with other antenatal nutritional interventions. We summarize key evidence on the above points and offer our views on good practices. Most developing countries have low calcium intake, so where habitual calcium intake is unknown, calcium supplements are likely beneficial. In our view, policymakers and program planners should consider adopting doses between 1.0 and 1.5 g elemental calcium/d, depending on the local average and variation in dietary calcium intake, logistical feasibility, and acceptability in the target population. Prudent practice would entail daily administration as calcium carbonate administered in divided doses of not >500 mg elemental calcium per dose. For ease of prescribing and adherence, calcium [as with iron and folic acid (IFA)] should be administered routinely to pregnant women from the earliest contact in pregnancy until delivery. Calcium's acute inhibitory effect on iron absorption translates to minimal effects in clinical studies. Therefore, to simplify the regimen and facilitate adherence, providers should not counsel that calcium and IFA pills must be taken separately. Although further research will shed more light on clinical and programmatic issues, policies can be implemented with ongoing revision as we continue to learn what works to improve maternal and newborn health.", "27604770": "Prenatal supplementation with DHA improves attention at 5 y of age: a randomized controlled trial.\nBACKGROUND: Docosahexanoic acid (DHA) is an important constituent of the brain. Evidence from well-designed intervention trials of the long-term benefits of increasing DHA intake during pregnancy has been sparse. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated global cognition, behavior, and attention at age 5 y in the offspring of Mexican women who participated in a randomized controlled trial of prenatal DHA supplementation. DESIGN: A total of 1094 women were randomly assigned to receive 400 mg of either DHA or placebo/d from 18 to 22 wk of pregnancy until delivery. We assessed cognitive development and behavioral and executive functioning, including attention, in 797 offspring at age 5 y (82% of 973 live births) with the use of the McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities (MSCA), the parental scale of the Behavioral Assessment System for Children, Second Edition (BASC-2), and the Conners' Kiddie Continuous Performance Test (K-CPT). We compared the groups on raw scores, T-scores, and standardized scores, as appropriate. We examined heterogeneity by the quality of the home environment, maternal intelligence, and socioeconomic status. RESULTS: There were no group differences for MSCA scores (P > 0.05), but the positive effect of the home environment at 12 mo on general cognitive abilities was attenuated in the DHA group compared with in the placebo group (P-interaction < 0.05). There were no differences between groups on the BASC-2. On the K-CPT, offspring in the DHA group showed improved mean \u00b1 SD T-scores compared with those of the placebo group for omissions (DHA: 47.6 \u00b1 10.3; placebo: 49.6 \u00b1 11.2; P < 0.01) with no differences (P > 0.05) for the other K-CPT scores or of the proportion who were clinically at risk of attention deficit hyperactivity disorders after Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons.

Its endogenous production by stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 gives rise to its cis isoform, cis-palmitoleate. Although trans-palmitoleate is also synthesized in humans, it is mainly found as an exogenous source in ruminant fat and dairy products. Recently, palmitoleate was considered to be a lipokine based on evidence demonstrating its release from adipose tissue and its metabolic effects on distant organs. After this finding, research has been performed to determine whether palmitoleate has beneficial effects on metabolism and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Thus, the aim of this work was to review the current status of knowledge about palmitoleate, its metabolism, and its influence on metabolic abnormalities. Results have shown mixed cardiovascular effects, direct or inverse correlations with obesity, and hepatosteatosis, but a significant amelioration or prevention of insulin resistance and diabetes. Finally, the induction of palmitoleate release from adipose tissue, dietary intake, and its supplementation are all interventions with a potential impact on certain metabolic diseases.", "27224877": "Prebiotic nut compounds and human microbiota.\nNut consumption is clearly related to human health outcomes. Its beneficial effects have been mainly attributed to nut fatty acid profiles and content of vegetable protein, fiber, vitamins, minerals, phytosterols and phenolics.

There has been expanding research on the pleiotropic role of vitamin D in pregnancy and the implications of its deficiency on maternal-fetal outcomes. Several studies have associated low maternal vitamin D status to adverse outcomes in pregnancy, including preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, preterm births, low birth weight, and others. Several randomized controlled clinical trials of Vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy have also been conducted. Though some of the studies found improvement in pregnancy outcomes with vitamin D supplementation, others have not shown any association. In this article, we have critically reviewed the observational and interventional studies, published primarily within the past two years (January 2014 to February 2016) on the influence of vitamin D deficiency on pregnancy and the impact of its supplementation. The potential underlying mechanisms of vitamin D in regulating each of the outcomes have also been discussed.", "27604776": "Hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and kidney stones in long-term studies of vitamin D supplementation: a systematic review and meta-analysis.\nBACKGROUND: Vitamin D supplementation is increasingly being used in higher doses in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). However, adverse events from very large annual doses of vitamin D have been shown in 2 RCTs, whereas in a third RCT, low-dose vitamin D, with calcium supplements, was shown to increase kidney stone risk. OBJECTIVE: We analyzed the side effects related to calcium metabolism in RCTs, specifically hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and kidney stones, in participants who were given vitamin D supplements for \u226524 wk compared with in subjects in the placebo arm. DESIGN: The following 3 main online databases were searched: Ovid Medline (PubMed), EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library. Software was used for the meta-analysis. RESULTS: A total of 48 studies with 19,833 participants were identified, which reported \u22651 of the following side effects: hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, or kidney stones. Of these studies, kidney stones were reported in only 9 trials with a tendency for fewer subjects reporting stones in the vitamin D arm than in the placebo arm (RR: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.41, 1.09; P = 0.10). In 37 studies, hypercalcemia was shown with increased risk shown for the vitamin D group (RR: 1.54; 95% CI: 1.09, 2.18; P = 0.01). Similar increased risk of hypercalciuria was shown in 14 studies for the vitamin D group (RR: 1.64; 95% CI: 1.06, 2.53; P = 0.03). In subgroup analyses, it was shown that the effect of vitamin D supplementation on risk of hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, or kidney stones was not modified by baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D, vitamin D dose and duration, or calcium co-supplementation. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term vitamin D supplementation resulted in increased risks of hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria, which were not dose related. However, vitamin D supplementation did not increase risk of kidney stones. Additional large RCTs of long-term vitamin D supplementation are required to confirm these findings.", "27534631": "Assessing infant cognitive development after prenatal iodine supplementation.\nLittle information is available on infant behavioral development outcomes of prenatal iodine supplementation in regions of mild to moderate iodine deficiency. Studies performed to date, all of which relied on global developmental assessments, have yielded inconsistent findings with regard to psychomotor development, negative findings with regard to mental development, and no information as to the development of specific cognitive functions. Our review of these studies leads us to suspect that the use of global developmental assessments might partially explain the negative and inconsistent findings. To identify cognitive processes that might be sensitive to prenatal iodine supplementation, we examined the timing of thyroid hormone action on specific brain systems. The development of infant visual attention is sensitive to thyroid hormone during the early prenatal period, when the fetus is entirely dependent on maternal thyroid hormone. For this reason, infant visual attention has the potential to be a sensitive measure of infant outcomes in prenatal iodine supplementation studies. We suggest the assessment of infant visual attention, with follow-up examination of childhood executive functions, as a means of capturing the effects of maternal iodine deficiency and prenatal iodine supplementation on specific cognitive processes. In particular, we propose comparison of infant performance on global developmental tests and specialized tests of visual attention in pilot trials of prenatal iodine supplementation in regions of mild to moderate iodine deficiency. Only by comparing the 2 types of tests side by side will it be possible to establish whether the use of a sensitive measure of infant visual attention will increase the reliability of such supplementation studies. Recognizing that exposure misclassification may also provide a partial explanation for the inconsistent neurodevelopmental outcomes in previous studies, we suggest that urinary iodine concentration or creatinine-corrected iodine excretion be monitored regularly in such trials throughout the prenatal period.", "27806972": "Effects of green tea catechin extract on serum lipids in postmenopausal women: a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial.\nBACKGROUND: Green tea has been suggested to improve cardiovascular disease risk factors, including circulating lipid variables. However, current evidence is predominantly based on small, short-term randomized controlled trials conducted in diverse populations. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the efficacy and impact of green tea extract (GTE) supplementation high in epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) on blood lipids in healthy postmenopausal women. DESIGN: This was an ancillary study of a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm trial investigating the effects of a GTE supplement containing 1315 mg catechins (843 mg EGCG) on biomarkers of breast cancer risk. Participants were randomly assigned to receive GTE (n = 538) or placebo (n = 537) and were stratified by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) genotype activity (high COMT compared with low or intermediate COMT genotype activity). They consumed either 4 GTE or identical placebo capsules daily for 12 mo. A total of 936 women completed this substudy. Circulating lipid panels including total cholesterol (TC), HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides were measured at baseline and at months 6 and 12. RESULTS: Compared with placebo, 1-y supplementation with GTE capsules resulted in a significant reduction in circulating TC (-2.1% compared with 0.7%; P = 0.0004), LDL cholesterol (-4.1% compared with 0.9%; P < 0.0001) and non-HDL cholesterol (-3.1% compared with 0.4%; P = 0.0032). There was no change in HDL-cholesterol concentration, but triglyceride concentrations increased by 3.6% in the GTE group, whereas they decreased by 2.5% in the placebo group (P = 0.046). A significant reduction in TC was observed only among women with high (i.e., \u2265200 mg/dL) baseline TC concentrations (P-interaction = 0.01) who consumed GTE capsules. The effect of GTE on the increase in triglycerides was mainly observed among obese women and statin users (P-interaction = 0.06). CONCLUSION: Supplementation with GTE significantly reduced circulating TC and LDL-cholesterol concentrations, especially in those with elevated baseline TC concentrations.

In rural Bangladesh we examined cognitive and motor function and scholastic achievement in a cohort of children who were exposed to vitamin A in utero or at birth.Objective: The aim of this study was to examine independent and combined effects of antenatal and newborn supplementation with vitamin A on the cognitive function of children at 8 y of age.Design: A cohort of rural Bangladeshi children from 2 previous double-blind, placebo-controlled cluster-randomized trials were revisited at age 8 y between February 2013 and June 2014. Data on sociodemographic, social, and physical conditions; schooling; child care behavior; anthropometric measures; and cognitive function were collected with the use of various psychometric assessment tools.Results: Among 11,950 children from the parent trial who were last known to be alive, a subset of 1803 children balanced by treatment group in a selected contiguous study area were re-enrolled and 1613 (89%) provided consent for assessments. Of these, 1577 (87%) children had a complete cognitive evaluation. All groups were highly comparable on baseline variables collected in the previous trials and factors measured at re-enrollment. Overall, there was no impact of either maternal or newborn supplementation with vitamin A on intelligence, memory, and motor function. Compared with placebo, children who received both interventions had significantly better performance in reading, spelling, and math computation, with increased mean (95% CI) scores of 8.0 (2.2, 13.8), 6.8 (1.9, 11.7), and 4.8 (0.6, 9.0), respectively.Conclusions: General intelligence or memory and motor functions were not affected by antenatal or newborn supplementation with vitamin A.

Existing clinical trials have been limited by short duration, low doses of vitamin D, variability in participants' vitamin D-deficiency status, and the use of surrogate measures of body composition, insulin sensitivity, and insulin secretion.Objective: To address existing knowledge gaps, we conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to investigate whether vitamin D supplementation that is provided in a sufficient dose and duration to vitamin D-deficient individuals would improve insulin sensitivity or secretion as measured with the use of gold-standard methods. We hypothesized that vitamin D supplementation would improve insulin sensitivity and secretion compared with placebo.Design: Sixty-five overweight or obese, vitamin D-deficient (25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration \u226450 nmol/L) adults were randomly assigned to receive either a bolus oral dose of 100,000 IU cholecalciferol followed by 4000 IU cholecalciferol/d or a matching placebo for 16 wk. Before and after the intervention, participants received gold-standard assessments of body composition (via dual X-ray absorptiometry), insulin sensitivity (via hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps), and insulin secretion [via intravenous-glucose-tolerance tests (IVGTTs)].Results: Fifty-four participants completed the study [35 men and 19 women; mean \u00b1 SD age: 31.9 \u00b1 8.5 y; body mass index (in kg/m2): 30.9 \u00b1 4.4]. 25(OH)D increased with vitamin D supplementation compared with placebo (57.0 \u00b1 21.3 compared with 1.9 \u00b1 15.1 nmol/L, respectively; P = 0.02). Vitamin D and placebo groups did not differ in change in insulin sensitivity (0.02 \u00b1 2.0 compared with -0.03 \u00b1 2.8 mg \u00b7 kg-1 \u00b7 min-1, respectively; P = 0.9) or first-phase insulin secretion (-21 \u00b1 212 compared with 24 \u00b1 184 mU/L, respectively; P = 0.9). Results remained nonsignificant after adjustment for age, sex, percentage of body fat, sun exposure, physical activity, and dietary vitamin D intake (P > 0.1).Conclusions: Vitamin D supplementation does not improve insulin sensitivity or secretion in vitamin D-deficient, overweight or obese adults, despite using high-dose vitamin D supplementation and robust endpoint measures. Therefore, it is unlikely that vitamin D supplementation would be an effective strategy for reducing diabetes risk even in vitamin D-deficient populations.

Recent reports of adverse cardiovascular effects of supplemental calcium have raised concerns. OBJECTIVE: We investigated associations of supplemental, dietary, and total calcium intakes with all-cause, CVD-specific, and cancer-specific mortality in a large, prospective cohort. DESIGN: A total of 132,823 participants in the Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort, who were followed from baseline (1992 or 1993) through 2012 for mortality outcomes, were included in the analysis. Dietary and supplemental calcium information was first collected at baseline and updated in 1999 and 2003. Multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models with cumulative updating of exposures were used to calculate RRs and 95% CIs for associations between calcium intake and mortality. RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 17.5 y, 43,186 deaths occurred. For men, supplemental calcium intake was overall not associated with mortality outcomes (P-trend > 0.05 for all), but men who were taking \u22651000 mg supplemental calcium/d had a higher risk of all-cause mortality (RR: 1.17; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.33), which was primarily attributed to borderline statistically significant higher risk of CVD-specific mortality (RR: 1.22; 95% CI: 0.99, 1.51). For women, supplemental calcium was inversely associated with mortality from all causes [RR (95% CI): 0.90 (0.87, 0.94), 0.84 (0.80, 0.88), and 0.93 (0.87, 0.99) for intakes of 0.1 to <500, 500 to <1000, and \u22651000 mg/d, respectively; P-trend < 0.01]. Total calcium intake was inversely associated with mortality in women (P-trend < 0.01) but not in men; dietary calcium was not associated with all-cause mortality in either sex. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort, associations of calcium intake and mortality varied by sex. For women, total and supplemental calcium intakes are associated with lower mortality, whereas for men, supplemental calcium intake \u22651000 mg/d may be associated with higher all-cause and CVD-specific mortality.", "27431371": "Lutein and Zeaxanthin Isomers in Eye Health and Disease.\nCurrent evidence suggests lutein and its isomers play important roles in ocular development in utero and throughout the life span, in vision performance in young and later adulthood, and in lowering risk for the development of common age-related eye diseases in older age. These xanthophyll (oxygen-containing) carotenoids are found in a wide variety of vegetables and fruits, and they are present in especially high concentrations in leafy green vegetables. Additionally, egg yolks and human milk appear to be bioavailable sources. The prevalence of lutein, zeaxanthin, and meso-zeaxanthin in supplements is increasing. Setting optimal and safe ranges of intake requires additional research, particularly in pregnant and lactating women. Accumulating evidence about variable interindividual response to dietary intake of these carotenoids, based on genetic or metabolic influences, suggests that there may be subgroups that benefit from higher levels of intake and/or alternate strategies to improve lutein and zeaxanthin status.", "27184276": "Effect of Flavonoids on Upper Respiratory Tract Infections and Immune Function: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.\nPrevious research on animals indicates flavonoid compounds have immunomodulatory properties; however, human research remains inconclusive. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the efficacy of dietary flavonoids on upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) and immune function in healthy adults. A created search strategy was run against Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE and EMBASE classic, CINAHL, and AMED. The returned studies were initially screened, and 2 reviewers independently assessed the remaining studies for eligibility against prespecified criteria. Fourteen studies, of 387 initially identified, were included in this review, and the primary outcome measure was the effect of flavonoids on URTI incidence, duration, and severity. Of the included studies, flavonoid supplementation ranged from 0.2 to 1.2 g/d. Overall, flavonoid supplementation decreased URTI incidence by 33% (95% CI: 31%, 36%) compared with control, with no apparent adverse effects. Sick-day count was decreased by 40% with flavonoid supplementation, although unclear. Differences in bio-immune markers (e.g., interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interferon-\u03b3, neutrophils) were trivial between the intervention and control groups during the intervention and after exercise when a postintervention exercise bout was included. These findings suggest that flavonoids are a viable supplement to decrease URTI incidence in an otherwise healthy population.", "27797709": "Whey protein lowers blood pressure and improves endothelial function and lipid biomarkers in adults with prehypertension and mild hypertension: results from the chronic Whey2Go randomized controlled trial.\nBACKGROUND: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the greatest cause of death globally, and their reduction is a key public-health target. High blood pressure (BP) affects 1 in 3 people in the United Kingdom, and previous studies have shown that milk consumption is associated with lower BP. OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether intact milk proteins lower 24-h ambulatory blood pressure (AMBP) and other risk markers of CVD. DESIGN: The trial was a double-blinded, randomized, 3-way-crossover, controlled intervention study. Forty-two participants were randomly assigned to consume 2 \u00d7 28 g whey protein/d, 2 \u00d7 28 g Ca caseinate/d, or 2 \u00d7 27 g maltodextrin (control)/d for 8 wk separated by a 4-wk washout. The effects of these interventions were examined with the use of a linear mixed-model ANOVA. RESULTS: Thirty-eight participants completed the study. Significant reductions in 24-h BP [for systolic blood pressure (SBP): -3.9 mm Hg; for diastolic blood pressure (DBP): -2.5 mm Hg; P = 0.050 for both)] were observed after whey-protein consumption compared with control intake. After whey-protein supplementation compared with control intake, peripheral and central systolic pressures [-5.7 mm Hg (P = 0.007) and -5.4 mm Hg (P = 0.012), respectively] and mean pressures [-3.7 mm Hg (P = 0.025) and -4.0 mm Hg (P = 0.019), respectively] were also lowered. Flow-mediated dilation (FMD) increased significantly after both whey-protein and calcium-caseinate intakes compared with control intake [1.31% (P < 0.001) and 0.83% (P = 0.003), respectively]. Although both whey protein and calcium caseinate significantly lowered total cholesterol [-0.26 mmol/L (P = 0.013) and -0.20 mmol/L (P = 0.042), respectively], only whey protein decreased triacylglycerol (-0.23 mmol/L; P = 0.025) compared with the effect of the control. Soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 were reduced after whey protein consumption (P = 0.011) and after calcium-caseinate consumption (P = 0.039), respectively, compared with after control intake. CONCLUSIONS: The consumption of unhydrolyzed milk proteins (56 g/d) for 8 wk improved vascular reactivity, biomarkers of endothelial function, and lipid risk factors.

The primary objective of this narrative review is to describe current knowledge on the iron-malaria association, including recent findings and substantive qualitative results. Between 2012 and 2016 the MEDLINE database was searched for literature published about malaria and iron levels. Observational studies reported some protection of iron supplementation against malaria among iron-deficient children, while older clinical trials reported increased susceptibility to malaria among iron-supplemented children. However, iron supplements were not significantly associated with increased malaria risk in recent clinical trials or in a 2016 Cochrane review. Evidence of an iron-malaria association is limited by the following factors: the protective effect of control interventions, the limited follow-up of children, and the lack of homogenous iron indicators. The effects of previous health status and possible thresholds in iron levels should be investigated using a gold-standard combination of iron markers. Moreover, the benefits of iron supplementation require further evaluation.", "26773010": "Prebiotics, Fermentable Dietary Fiber, and Health Claims.\nSince the 1970s, the positive effects of dietary fiber on health have increasingly been recognized. The collective term \"dietary fiber\" groups structures that have different physiologic effects. Since 1995, some dietary fibers have been denoted as prebiotics, implying a beneficial physiologic effect related to increasing numbers or activity of the gastrointestinal microbiota. Given the complex composition of the microbiota, the demonstration of such beneficial effects is difficult. In contrast, an exploration of the metabolites of dietary fiber formed as a result of its fermentation in the colon offers better perspectives for providing mechanistic links between fiber intake and health benefits. Positive outcomes of such studies hold the promise that claims describing specific health benefits can be granted. This would help bridge the \"fiber gap\"-that is, the considerable difference between recommended and actual fiber intakes by the average consumer.", "27431367": "Homocysteine, B Vitamins, and Cognitive Impairment.\nModerately elevated plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) is a strong modifiable risk factor for vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Prospectively, elevated tHcy is associated with cognitive decline, white matter damage, brain atrophy, neurofibrillary tangles, and dementia. Most homocysteine-lowering trials with folate and vitamins B6 and/or B12 tested as protective agents against cognitive decline were poorly designed by including subjects unlikely to benefit during the trial period. In contrast, trials in high-risk subjects, which have taken into account the baseline B vitamin status, show a slowing of cognitive decline and of atrophy in critical brain regions, results that are consistent with modification of the Alzheimer's disease process. Homocysteine may interact with both risk factors and protective factors, thereby identifying people at risk but also providing potential strategies for early intervention. Public health steps to slow cognitive decline should be promoted in individuals who are at risk of dementia, and more trials are needed to see if simple interventions with nutrients can prevent progression to dementia.", "28877893": "Randomized controlled trial on the impact of early-life intervention with bifidobacteria on the healthy infant fecal microbiota and metabolome.\nBackground: Early-life colonization of the intestinal tract is a dynamic process influenced by numerous factors. The impact of probiotic-supplemented infant formula on the composition and function of the infant gut microbiota is not well defined.Objective: We sought to determine the effects of a bifidobacteria-containing formula on the healthy human intestinal microbiome during the first year of life.Design: A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of newborn infants assigned to a standard whey-based formula containing a total of 107 colony-forming units (CFU)/g of Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium longum, B. longum subspecies infantis (intervention), or to a control formula without bifidobacteria (placebo). Breastfed controls were included. Diversity and composition of fecal microbiota were determined by 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing, and metabolite profiles were analyzed by ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry over a period of 2 y.Results: Infants (n = 106) were randomly assigned to either the interventional (n = 48) or placebo (n = 49) group; 9 infants were exclusively breastfed throughout the entire intervention period of 12 mo. Infants exposed to bifidobacteria-supplemented formula showed decreased occurrence of Bacteroides and Blautia spp. associated with changes in lipids and unknown metabolites at month 1. Microbiota and metabolite profiles of intervention and placebo groups converged during the study period, and long-term colonization (24 mo) of the supplemented Bifidobacterium strains was not detected. Significant differences in microbiota and metabolites were detected between infants fed breast milk and those fed formula (P < 0.005) and between infants birthed vaginally and those birthed by cesarean delivery (P < 0.005). No significant differences were observed between infant feeding groups regarding growth, antibiotic uptake, or other health variables (P > 0.05).Conclusion: The supplementation of bifidobacteria to infant diet can modulate the occurrence of specific bacteria and metabolites during early life with no detectable long-term effects.

One way to reduce LDL-C levels is to inhibit cholesterol absorption. Plant sterols and stanols compete with cholesterol for absorption in the intestine and induce an average decrease in LDL-C by 5% to 15% in a dose-dependent manner, but not in all individuals. This review focuses on the interindividual variability in response to dietary supplementation with plant sterols and stanols. Dietary plant sterols and stanols have no significant effects on LDL-C in substantial numbers of individuals. Higher responses, in absolute value and percentage of LDL-C, are observed in individuals with higher cholesterol absorption and a lower rate of cholesterol synthesis. Some data provide evidence of the influence of genetics on the response to plant sterols and stanols. Further studies in large populations are required to extend these conclusions about genetic influences.", "28490516": "The positive impact of general vitamin D food fortification policy on vitamin D status in a representative adult Finnish population: evidence from an 11-y follow-up based on standardized 25-hydroxyvitamin D data.\nBackground: A systematic vitamin D fortification of fluid milk products and fat spreads was started in 2003 in Finland to improve vitamin D status. Objective: We investigated the effects of the vitamin D fortification policy on vitamin D status in Finland between 2000 and 2011.Design: Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [S-25(OH)D] concentrations of a nationally representative sample comprising 6134 and 4051 adults aged \u226530 y from the Health 2000 and Health 2011 surveys, respectively, were standardized according to the Vitamin D Standardization Program with the use of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Linear and logistic regression models were used to assess the change in S-25(OH)D concentrations.Results: Between 2000 and 2011, the mean S-25(OH)D increased from 48 nmol/L (95% CI: 47, 48 nmol/L) to 65 nmol/L (95% CI: 65, 66 nmol/L) (P < 0.001). The prevalence of vitamin D supplement users increased from 11% to 41% (P < 0.001). When analyzing the effect of fortification of fluid milk products, we focused on supplement nonusers. The mean increase in S-25(OH)D in daily fluid milk consumers (n = 1017) among supplement nonusers was 20 nmol/L (95% CI: 19, 21 nmol/L), which was 6 nmol/L higher than nonconsumers (n = 229) (14 nmol/L; 95% CI: 12, 16 nmol/L) (P < 0.001). In total, 91% of nonusers who consumed fluid milk products, fat spreads, and fish based on Finnish nutrition recommendations reached S-25(OH)D concentrations >50 nmol/L in 2011.Conclusions: The vitamin D status of the Finnish adult population has improved considerably during the time period studied. The increase is mainly explained by food fortification, especially of fluid milk products, and augmented vitamin D supplement use. Other factors, such as the difference in the ultraviolet radiation index between 2000 and 2011, may partly explain the results. When consuming vitamin D sources based on the nutritional recommendations, vitamin D status is sufficient [S-25(OH)D \u226550 nmol/L], and supplementation is generally not needed.", "28152316": "n-3 Ingestion may modulate the severity of periodontal disease? Systematic review.\nThe aim of this study was to determine the effects of n-3 ingestion on periodontal disease. Besides, we also investigated the relationship between plasma concentrations of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and/or aracdonic acid (AA), and periodontal disease. An electronic search was performed in several databases with the following keywords: \"n-3,\" DHA, EPA and polynsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in combination with the term \"periodontal disease\" (PD). Only studies conducted with humans, involving clinical parameters of PD assessment and use of n-3 were selected, without restriction to the date of publication. The search has returned 1368 articles, 11 of which were selected. The results were separated according to the type of n-3 ingestion: supplementation or n-3 content in normal diet. In the studies where n-3 has been supplemented, there was no significant difference in the clinical severity of PD compared to the control subjects. However, in patients where levels of n-3 were evaluated in a usual diet, a lower disease severity was reported. We have detected a preventive effect related to plasma levels of EPA and DHA against PD progression. Thus, n-3 ingestion may beneficially interfere in PD progression, depending on the duration and dosage of consumption.", "27806977": "Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of choline supplementation in school-aged children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders.\nBACKGROUND: Prenatal alcohol exposure results in a broad range of cognitive and behavioral impairments. Because of the long-lasting problems that are associated with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs), the development of effective treatment programs is critical. Preclinical animal studies have shown that choline, which is an essential nutrient, can attenuate the severity of alcohol-related cognitive impairments. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to translate preclinical findings to a clinical population to investigate whether choline supplementation can ameliorate the severity of memory, executive function, and attention deficits in children with FASDs. DESIGN: In the current study, which was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, we explored the effectiveness of a choline intervention for children with FASDs who were aged 5-10 y. Fifty-five children with confirmed histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure were randomly assigned to either the choline (n = 29) or placebo (n = 26) treatment arms. Participants in the choline group received 625 mg choline/d for 6 wk, whereas subjects in the placebo group received an equivalent dose of an inactive placebo treatment. Primary outcomes, including the performance on neuropsychological measures of memory, executive function, and attention and hyperactivity, were assessed at baseline and postintervention. RESULTS: Compared with the placebo group, participants in the choline group did not differentially improve in cognitive performance in any domain. Treatment compliance and mean dietary choline intake were not predictive of treatment outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Findings of the current study do not support that choline, administered at a dose of 625 mg/d for 6 wk, is an effective intervention for school-aged (5-10 y old) children with FASDs. This research provides important information about choline's therapeutic window. Combined with other studies of choline and nutritional interventions in this population, this study emphasizes a further need for the continued study of the role of nutritional status and supplementation in children with FASDs and the contributions of nutrition to neurocognition.

OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the efficacy of small-quantity, lipid-based nutrient supplements (SQ-LNSs) provided during pregnancy, lactation, and infancy on attained size by 18 mo of age. DESIGN: In this partially double-blind, individually randomized trial, 1320 women at \u226420 wk of gestation received standard iron and folic acid (IFA group), multiple micronutrients (MMN group), or SQ-LNS (LNS group) daily until delivery, and then placebo, MMNs, or SQ-LNS, respectively, for 6 mo postpartum; infants in the LNS group received SQ-LNS formulated for infants from 6 to 18 mo of age (endline). The primary outcome was child length by 18 mo of age. RESULTS: At endline, data were available for 85% of 1228 infants enrolled; overall mean length and length-for-age z score (LAZ) were 79.3 cm and -0.83, respectively, and 12% of the children were stunted (LAZ <-2). In analysis based on the intended treatment, mean \u00b1 SD length and LAZ for the LNS group (79.7 \u00b1 2.9 cm and -0.69 \u00b1 1.01, respectively) were significantly greater than for the IFA (79.1 \u00b1 2.9 cm and -0.87 \u00b1 0.99) and MMN (79.1 \u00b1 2.9 cm and -0.91 \u00b1 1.01) groups (P = 0.006 and P = 0.009, respectively). Differences were also significant for weight and weight-for-age z score but not head or midupper arm circumference, and the prevalence of stunting in the LNS group was 8.9%, compared with 13.7% in the IFA group and 12.9% in the MMN group (P = 0.12). In analysis based on actual supplement provided at enrollment, stunting prevalences were 8.9% compared with 15.1% and 11.5%, respectively (P = 0.045). CONCLUSION: Provision of SQ-LNSs to women from pregnancy to 6 mo postpartum and to their infants from 6 to 18 mo of age may increase the child's attained length by age 18 mo in similar settings.

The objective of the current article is to describe the harmonization plan and the results of initial iodine analyses accomplished under that plan. For many years, the FDA's Total Diet Study (TDS) has measured iodine concentrations in selected foods collected in 4 regions of the country each year. For more than a decade, the NDL has collected and analyzed foods as part of the National Food and Nutrient Analysis Program; iodine analysis is now being added to the program. The NDL recently qualified a commercial laboratory to conduct iodine analysis of foods by an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) method. Co-analysis of a set of samples by the commercial laboratory using the ICP-MS method and by the FDA laboratory using its standard colorimetric method yielded comparable results. The FDA recently reviewed historical TDS data for trends in the iodine content of selected foods, and the NDL analyzed samples of a limited subset of those foods for iodine. The FDA and the NDL are working to combine their data on iodine in foods and to produce an online database that can be used for estimating iodine intake from foods in the US population. In addition, the NDL continues to analyze dietary supplements for iodine and, in collaboration with the NIH Office of Dietary Supplements, to publish the data online in the Dietary Supplement Ingredient Database.

Folic acid, alone or in combination with other B vitamins, is the most recommended vitamin consumed during pregnancy because deficiency of this vitamin leads to birth defects in the infant. Folic acid and other B vitamins are also integral components of biochemical processes that are essential to the development of regulatory systems that control the ability of the offspring to adapt to the external environment. Although few human studies have investigated the lasting effects of high vitamin intakes during pregnancy, animal models have shown that excess vitamin supplementation during gestation is associated with negative metabolic effects in both the mothers and their offspring.

Current strategies used to manage this disease are not sufficient, although the use of human breast milk reduces the risk of NEC. Mother's milk is regarded as a fundamental nutritional source for neonates, but pasteurization of donor breast milk affects the composition of bioactive compounds. Current research is evaluating the benefits and potential pitfalls of adding probiotics and prebiotics to pasteurized milk so as to improve the functionality of the milk and thereby reduce the burden of illness caused by NEC. Probiotics (live micro-organisms that confer health to the host) and prebiotics (nondigestible oligosaccharides that stimulate the growth of healthy bacteria) are functional foods known to mediate immune responses and modulate microbial populations in the gut. Clinical research shows strain- and compound-specific responses when probiotics or prebiotics are administered in conjunction with donor breast milk for the prevention of NEC. Despite ongoing controversy surrounding optimal treatment strategies, randomized controlled studies are now investigating the use of synbiotics to reduce the incidence and severity of NEC. Synbiotics, a combination of probiotics and prebiotics, have been proposed to enhance beneficial health effects in the intestinal tract more than either agent administered alone. This review considers the implications of using probiotic-, prebiotic-, and synbiotic-supplemented breast milk as a strategy to prevent NEC and issues that could be encountered with the preparations.", "27604772": "Vitamin D status and weight loss: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized and nonrandomized controlled weight-loss trials.\nBACKGROUND: Obesity is associated with lower concentrations of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D; however, uncertainty exists as to the direction of causation. To date, meta-analyses of randomized controlled vitamin D-supplementation trials have shown no effect of raising circulating vitamin D on body weight, although several weight-loss-intervention trials have reported an increase in circulating vitamin D after weight reduction. OBJECTIVE: We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized and nonrandomized controlled trials to determine whether weight loss compared with weight maintenance leads to an increase in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D. DESIGN: A systematic search for controlled weight-loss-intervention studies published up to 31 March 2016 was performed. Studies that included participants of any age with changes in adiposity and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D as primary or secondary outcomes were considered eligible. RESULTS: We identified 4 randomized controlled trials (n = 2554) and 11 nonrandomized controlled trials (n = 917) for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Random assignment to weight loss compared with weight maintenance resulted in a greater increase in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D with a mean difference of 3.11 nmol/L (95% CI: 1.38, 4.84 nmol/L) between groups, whereas a mean difference of 4.85 nmol/L (95% CI: 2.59, 7.12 nmol/L) was observed in nonrandomized trials. No evidence for a dose-response effect of weight loss on the change in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D was shown overall. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that vitamin D status may be marginally improved with weight loss in comparison with weight maintenance under similar conditions of supplemental vitamin D intake. Although additional studies in unsupplemented individuals are needed to confirm these findings, our results support the view that the association between obesity and lower serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D may be due to reversed causation with increased adiposity leading to suboptimal concentrations of circulating vitamin D.

Universal salt iodization is the first-line strategy for the elimination of severe iodine deficiency. Iodine supplementation is recommended for vulnerable groups in severely iodine-deficient regions where salt iodization is infeasible or insufficient. A recent clinical trial has informed best practices for iodine supplementation of severely iodine-deficient lactating mothers. Because of successful programs of universal salt iodization in formerly severely iodine-deficient regions around the world, public health concern has shifted toward mild to moderate iodine deficiency, which remains prevalent in many regions, especially among pregnant women. Observational studies have shown associations between both mild maternal iodine deficiency and mild maternal thyroid hypofunction and decreased child cognition. Iodine supplementation has been shown to improve indexes of maternal thyroid function, even in marginally iodine-deficient areas. However, no data are yet available from randomized controlled trials in regions of mild to moderate iodine insufficiency on the relation between maternal iodine supplementation and neurobehavioral development in the offspring; thus, the long-term benefits and safety of such supplementation are uncertain. Although it is clear that excessive iodine intake can cause alterations in thyroid function in susceptible individuals, safe upper limits for iodine intake in pregnancy have not been well defined. Well-designed, prospective, randomized controlled trials that examine the effects of iodine supplementation on maternal thyroid function and infant neurobehavioral development in mildly to moderately iodine-deficient pregnant women are urgently needed.

The required amount of iodine in infant formulas is based on caloric content, and the label must provide the iodine content per 100 kcal. Cuprous iodide and potassium iodide may be added to table salt as a source of dietary iodine at a maximum amount of 0.01%; if added, the label must indicate that the salt is iodized. Table salt to which iodine has not been added must bear the statement, \"This salt does not supply iodide, a necessary nutrient.\" If a nutrient is to be appropriately added to a food for the purpose of correcting a dietary insufficiency, there should be sufficient scientific information available to demonstrate a nutritional deficiency and/or identify a public health problem. Furthermore, the population groups that would benefit from the proposed fortification should be identified. If iodine is added to a food, the percent Daily Value of iodine must be listed. There are no FDA regulations governing ingredient standards for dietary supplements. As a result, some dietary supplements include iodine and others do not. If a supplement contains iodine, the Supplement Facts label must list iodine as a nutrient ingredient. If iodine is not listed on the Supplement Facts label, then it has not been added. There are similarities between the FDA, which establishes US food regulations and policies, and the Codex Alimentarius (Codex), which develops international food standards and guidelines under the aegis of the FAO and the WHO.

The objective of this systematic review was to compile and assess studies that determined zinc transporter and/or metallothionein expression in various blood cell types and to determine their reliability and sensitivity to changes in dietary zinc. Sixteen studies were identified that determined the expression of zrt-, irt-like protein (ZIP) 1 [solute carrier family (SLC) 39A1], ZIP3 (SLC39A3), ZIP5 (SLC39A5), ZIP6 (SLC39A6), ZIP7 (SLC39A7), ZIP8 (SLC39A8), ZIP10 (SLC39A10), ZIP14 (SLC39A14), zinc transporter (ZnT)1 (SLC30A1), ZnT2 (SLC30A2), ZnT4 (SLC30A4), ZnT5 (SLC30A5), ZnT6 (SLC30A6), ZnT7 (SLC30A7), ZnT9 (SLC30A9), and/or metallothionein in various blood cells isolated from healthy adult men and women in response to zinc supplementation or depletion. Cell types included leukocytes, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, T lymphocytes, monocytes, and erythrocytes. ZIP1, ZnT1, and metallothionein were the most commonly measured proteins. Changes in ZIP1 and ZnT1 in response to zinc supplementation or depletion were not consistent across studies. Leukocyte metallothionein decreased with zinc depletion (-39% change from baseline, <5 mg Zn/d, n = 2 studies) and increased with zinc supplementation in a dose-dependent manner (35%, 15-22 mg Zn/d, n = 7 studies; 267%, 50 mg Zn/d, n = 2 studies) and at the earliest time points measured; however, no change or delayed response was observed in metallothionein in erythrocytes. A greater percentage of studies demonstrated that metallothionein in leukocyte subtypes was a more reliable (100%, n = 12; 69%, n = 16) and responsive (92%, n = 12; 82%, n = 11) indicator of zinc exposure than was plasma zinc, respectively.

The mucosal immune system plays a critical role in the onset of seafood allergy and other allergic diseases. Recently, experimental and clinical evidence has shown that probiotics significantly modulate immune responses and thus suppress allergic reactions. Therefore, in this review, we summarized the basic knowledge of seafood allergy, the mucosal immune system, and probiotic activities. We also reviewed the critical immune factors involved in allergic reactions, as well as the potential mechanism and the potential use of probiotics to ameliorate seafood allergy.

We previously showed that 3-d supplementation of combined epigallocatechin-3-gallate and resveratrol (EGCG+RES) increased energy expenditure and improved the capacity to switch from fat toward carbohydrate oxidation with a high-fat mixed meal (HFMM) test in men. OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to investigate the longer-term effect of EGCG+RES supplementation on metabolic profile, mitochondrial capacity, fat oxidation, lipolysis, and tissue-specific insulin sensitivity. DESIGN: In this randomized double-blind study, 38 overweight and obese subjects [18 men; aged 38 \u00b1 2 y; body mass index (kg/m(2)): 29.7 \u00b1 0.5] received either EGCG+RES (282 and 80 mg/d, respectively) or placebo for 12 wk. Before and after the intervention, oxidative capacity and gene expression were assessed in skeletal muscle. Fasting and postprandial (HFMM) lipid metabolism was assessed by using indirect calorimetry, blood sampling, and microdialysis. Tissue-specific insulin sensitivity was assessed by a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp with [6,6-(2)H2]-glucose infusion. RESULTS: EGCG+RES supplementation did not affect the fasting plasma metabolic profile. Although whole-body fat mass was not affected, visceral adipose tissue mass tended to decrease after the intervention compared with placebo (P-time \u00d7 treatment = 0.09). EGCG+RES supplementation significantly increased oxidative capacity in permeabilized muscle fibers (P-time \u00d7 treatment < 0.05, P-EGCG+RES < 0.05). Moreover, EGCG+RES reduced fasting (P-time \u00d7 treatment = 0.03) and postprandial respiratory quotient (P-time \u00d7 treatment = 0.01) compared with placebo. Fasting and postprandial fat oxidation was not significantly affected by EGCG+RES (P-EGCG+RES = 0.46 and 0.38, respectively) but declined after placebo (P-placebo = 0.05 and 0.03, respectively). Energy expenditure was not altered (P-time \u00d7 treatment = 0.96). Furthermore, EGCG+RES supplementation attenuated the increase in plasma triacylglycerol concentrations during the HFMM test that was observed after placebo (P-time \u00d7 treatment = 0.04, P-placebo = 0.01). Finally, EGCG+RES had no effect on insulin-stimulated glucose disposal, suppression of endogenous glucose production, or lipolysis. CONCLUSION: Twelve weeks of EGCG+RES supplementation increased mitochondrial capacity and stimulated fat oxidation compared with placebo, but this did not translate into increased tissue-specific insulin sensitivity in overweight and obese subjects.

OBJECTIVE: We investigated the relation between vitamin C supplement intake and breast cancer risk while considering dietary vitamin C intake. DESIGN: Between 1995 and 2008, 2482 invasive breast cancer cases occurred in 57,403 postmenopausal women from the Etude Epid\u00e9miologique aupr\u00e8s de femmes de la Mutuelle G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l'Education Nationale (E3N) prospective cohort during 581,085 person-years. We estimated vitamin C intake from foods with the use of a validated food-frequency questionnaire that was sent to subjects in 1993-1995 and vitamin C supplement use via questionnaires sent in 1995, 2000, 2002, and 2005. Multivariable HRs (95% CIs) for primary invasive breast cancer were estimated with the use of Cox regression models. All statistical tests were 2-sided. RESULTS: Vitamin C supplement use (ever compared with never) was not associated with breast cancer risk overall; it was associated with higher breast cancer risk in women in the fourth quartile of vitamin C intake from foods (HR: 1.32; 95% CI: 1.04, 1.67) but not in other quartiles of dietary vitamin C intake (P-interaction = 0.03).

Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox proportionate hazard models were used to test the hypotheses with adjustment for pertinent covariables.Results: During a median treatment duration of 4.5 y, 616 participants developed a first stroke (497 ischemic strokes). A high FBG concentration (\u22657.0 mmol/L) or diabetes, compared with a low FBG concentration (<5.0 mmol/L), was associated with an increased risk of first stroke (6.0% compared with 2.6%, respectively; HR: 1.9; 95% CI: 1.3, 2.8; P < 0.001). Folic acid treatment reduced the risk of stroke across a wide range of FBG concentrations \u22655.0 mmol/L, but risk reduction was greatest in subjects with FBG concentrations \u22657.0 mmol/L or with diabetes (HR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.46, 0.97; P < 0.05). There was a significant interactive effect of FBG and folic acid treatment on first stroke (P = 0.01).Conclusions: In Chinese hypertensive adults, an FBG concentration \u22657.0 mmol/L or diabetes is associated with an increased risk of first stroke; this increased risk is reduced by 34% with folic acid treatment. These findings warrant additional investigation.

Developing effective and safe strategies to manage excess body weight is therefore of paramount importance. One potential strategy to reduce obesity is to consume conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) supplements containing isomers cis-9, trans-11 and trans-10, cis-12, or trans-10, cis-12 alone. Proposed antiobesity mechanisms of CLA include regulation of (a) adipogenesis, (b) lipid metabolism, (c) inflammation, (d) adipocyte apoptosis, (e) browning or beiging of adipose tissue, and (f) energy metabolism. However, causality of CLA-mediated responses to body fat loss, particularly the linkage between inflammation, thermogenesis, and energy metabolism, is unclear. This review examines whether CLA's antiobesity properties are due to inflammatory signaling and considers CLA's linkage with lipogenesis, lipolysis, thermogenesis, and browning of white and brown adipose tissue. We propose a series of questions and studies to interrogate the role of the sympathetic nervous system in mediating CLA's antiobesity properties.", "28298277": "Supplementation of Infant Formula with Bovine Milk Fat Globule Membranes.\nStudies have shown that supplementation of infant formula with bovine milk fat globule membranes (MFGMs) may substantially narrow the gap in health outcomes between formula-fed and breastfed infants. In one study, consumption of a formula supplemented with a lipid-rich MFGM concentrate between 2 and 6 mo of age improved cognitive performance at 24 wk of age. In another study, a formula supplemented with a protein-rich MFGM concentrate given between 2 and 6 mo of age improved cognitive performance at 12 mo of age, decreased infectious morbidity until 6 mo of age, and yielded serum cholesterol concentrations closer to those of breastfed infants. A third study that assessed the safety of supplementing infant formula with a lipid-rich or a protein-rich MFGM concentrate found a noninferior weight gain for both groups compared with a nonsupplemented formula. In this study, there was an increased risk of eczema in the protein-rich group, but no serious adverse events. Infant formulas with supplemental MFGMs have been launched on the market in several countries. However, the evidence base must still be considered quite limited. Based on 3 randomized controlled trials that are not comparable, the intervention seems safe, but there is not enough evidence for a general recommendation on which MFGM fraction to use and at what concentration as formula supplement for a given outcome.", "27797708": "Randomized clinical trial on the efficacy of hesperidin 2S on validated cardiovascular biomarkers in healthy overweight individuals.\nBACKGROUND: Endothelial dysfunction (ED) is involved in the development of atherosclerosis. Hesperidin, a citrus flavonoid with antioxidant and other biological properties, potentially exerts beneficial effects on endothelial function (EF). OBJECTIVE: We investigated the effect of hesperidin 2S supplementation on EF in overweight individuals. DESIGN: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in which 68 individuals were randomly assigned to receive hesperidin 2S (450 mg/d) or a placebo for 6 wk. At baseline and after 6 wk of intervention, flow-mediated dilation (FMD), soluble vascular adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), soluble intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), soluble P-selectin (sP-selectin), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were assessed. Acute, reversible ED was induced by intake of a high-fat meal (HFM). A second FMD scan was performed 2 h postprandially, and adhesion molecules were assessed 2 and 4 h postprandially. An additional exploratory analysis was performed in subjects with baseline FMD \u22653%. RESULTS: No significant change in fasting or postprandial FMD was observed after 6 wk of hesperidin intake compared with placebo intake. However, there was a trend for a reduction of sVCAM-1, sICAM-1, sP-selectin, SBP, and DBP after 6 wk of hesperidin treatment. In the FMD \u22653% group, hesperidin protected individuals from postprandial ED (P = 0.050) and significantly downregulated sVCAM-1 and sICAM-1 (all P \u2264 0.030). The results reported in the current article were not adjusted for multiplicity. CONCLUSIONS: Six weeks of consumption of hesperidin 2S did not improve basal or postprandial FMD in our total study population. There was a tendency toward a reduction of adhesion molecules and a decrease in SBP and DBP. Further exploratory analyses revealed that, in subjects with baseline FMD \u22653%, hesperidin 2S improved ED after an HFM and reduced adhesion molecules. These results indicate the cardiovascular health benefits of hesperidin 2S in overweight and obese individuals with a relatively healthy endothelium.

OBJECTIVE: We examined whether zinc carnosine (ZnC), a health-food product taken alone or in combination with bovine colostrum (a natural source of growth factors), would moderate such effects. DESIGN: Eight volunteers completed a 4-arm, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover protocol (14 d of placebo, ZnC, colostrum, or ZnC plus colostrum) before undertaking standardized exercise 2 and 14 d after the start of treatment. Changes in epithelial resistance, apoptosis signaling molecules, and tight junction (TJ) protein phosphorylation in response to a 2\u00b0C rise in body temperature were determined with the use of Caco-2 and HT29 intestinal cells. RESULTS: Body temperature increased 2\u00b0C, and gut permeability (5-h urinary lactulose:rhamnose ratios) increased 3-fold after exercise (from 0.32 \u00b1 0.016 baseline to 1.0 \u00b1 0.017 at 14 d; P < 0.01). ZnC or colostrum truncated the rise by 70% after 14 d of treatment. The combination treatment gave an additional benefit, and truncated exercise induced increase at 2 d (30% reduction; P < 0.01). A 2\u00b0C temperature rise in in vitro studies caused the doubling of apoptosis and reduced epithelial resistance 3-4-fold. ZnC or colostrum truncated these effects (35-50%) with the greatest response seen with the combination treatment (all P < 0.01). Mechanisms of action included increasing heat shock protein 70 and truncating temperature-induced changes in B cell leukemia/lymphoma-2 associated X protein \u03b1 and B cell lymphoma 2. ZnC also increased total occludin and reduced phosphorylated tyrosine claudin, phosphorylated tyrosine occludin, and phosphorylated serine occludin, thereby enhancing the TJ formation and stabilization. CONCLUSION: ZnC, taken alone or with colostrum, increased epithelial resistance and the TJ structure and may have value for athletes and in the prevention of heat stroke in military personnel.

OBJECTIVES: We described the distribution of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 [25(OH)D3], 3-epi-25(OH)D3, and 25(OH)D2 in early pregnancy and investigated associations with pre-eclampsia and small-for-gestational-age (SGA) birth, which are indicative of uteroplacental dysfunction. DESIGN: The SCOPE (Screening for Pregnancy Endpoints) Ireland prospective pregnancy cohort study included 1768 well-characterized low-risk, nulliparous women resident at 52\u00b0N. Serum 25(OH)D3, 3-epi-25(OH)D3, and 25(OH)D2 were quantified at 15 wk of gestation with the use of a CDC-accredited liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method. RESULTS: The mean \u00b1 SD total 25(OH)D concentration was 56.7 \u00b1 25.9 nmol/L, and 17% and 44% of women had 25(OH)D concentrations <30 and <50 nmol/L, respectively. The prevalence of pre-eclampsia was 3.8%, and 10.7% of infants were SGA. There was a lower risk of pre-eclampsia plus SGA combined (13.6%) at 25(OH)D concentrations >75 nmol/L (adjusted OR: 0.64; 95% CI: 0.43, 0.96). The main predictors of 25(OH)D were the use of vitamin D-containing supplements (adjusted mean difference: 20.1 nmol/L; 95% CI: 18.5, 22.7 nmol/L) and summer sampling (adjusted mean difference: 15.5 nmol/L; 95% CI: 13.4, 17.6 nmol/L). Non-Caucasian ethnicity (adjusted mean difference: -19.3 nmol/L; 95% CI: -25.4, -13.2 nmol/L) and smoking (adjusted mean difference: -7.0 nmol/L; 95% CI: -10.5, -3.6 nmol/L) were negative predictors of 25(OH)D. The mean \u00b1 SD concentration of 3-epi-25(OH)D3, which was detectable in 99.9% of samples, was 2.6 \u00b1 1.6 nmol/L. Determinants of 3-epi-25(OH)D3 were 25(OH)D3 (adjusted mean difference: 0.052 nmol/L; 95% CI: 0.050, 0.053 nmol/L) and maternal age (adjusted mean difference: -0.018 nmol/L; 95% CI: -0.026, -0.009 nmol/L). The mean \u00b1 SD concentration of 25(OH)D2 was 3.1 \u00b1 2.7 nmol/L, which was present in all samples. No adverse effects of 25(OH)D concentrations >125 nmol/L were observed. CONCLUSIONS: In the first report to our knowledge of CDC-accredited 25(OH)D data and pregnancy outcomes from a large, clinically validated, prospective cohort study, we observed a protective association of a 25(OH)D concentration >75 nmol/L and a reduced risk of uteroplacental dysfunction as indicated by a composite outcome of SGA and pre-eclampsia.

However, the relation between maternal betaine status and offspring birth weight and body composition is less known. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to examine the association between maternal betaine status and neonatal birth size and adiposity in an Asian mother-offspring cohort. DESIGN: We included 955 pregnant women whose plasma betaine concentrations were measured at 26-28 wk of gestation. Neonatal anthropometric values were measured at birth, and abdominal adipose tissue compartments were assessed by MRI in a subset of infants (n = 307) in the first 14 d after birth. Multivariate general linear models were used to adjust for gestational age; fetal sex; and maternal age, height, education, ethnicity, prepregnancy body mass index, and plasma folate, vitamin B-12, and choline concentrations. RESULTS: The mean \u00b1 SD plasma concentration of betaine was 13.2 \u00b1 2.7 \u03bcmol/L (range: 5.3-25.0 \u03bcmol/L). After adjustment for covariates, higher maternal plasma betaine was associated with lower birth weight (\u03b2: -57.6 g; 95% CI: -109.9, -5.3 g), shorter birth length (\u03b2: -0.29 cm per 5-\u03bcmol/L increment; 95% CI: -0.55, -0.03 cm), smaller head circumference (-0.20 cm; 95% CI: -0.38, -0.02 cm), smaller midupper arm circumference (-0.16 cm; 95% CI: -0.30, -0.03 cm), lower volumes of abdominal superficial subcutaneous adipose tissue (-4.53 mL; 95% CI: -8.70, -0.36 mL), and a higher risk of small-for-gestational-age birth (OR: 1.57; 95% CI: 1.05, 2.35). CONCLUSIONS: Higher maternal betaine status was generally associated with smaller infant birth size and less abdominal fat mass.

Following the recent observation that the gut microbiota is altered in diabetic patients, researchers investigated the effect of probiotics in patients with diabetes. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this systematic review was to assess the effects of probiotic consumption on glycemic control in diabetic patients. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science (formerly ISI Web of Knowledge), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses databases were searched up to November 2015. STUDY SELECTION: Clinical trials in diabetic patients in whom probiotics were administered as an intervention were included. DATA EXTRACTION: Primary outcomes were fasting blood glucose, insulin concentration, insulin resistance, and hemoglobin A1c. Secondary outcomes were adverse events. DATA SYNTHESIS: Of the 2736 reports that were screened, 13 clinical trials met the inclusion criteria. Pooling data from eligible clinical trials revealed that probiotic supplementation significantly (P\u2009<\u20090.05) decreased fasting blood glucose and hemoglobin A1c in diabetic patients, although the participants' characteristics (eg, body mass index) and the number and type of probiotic microorganisms affected the clinical response. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of probiotics appears to have a beneficial role in the management of type 2 diabetes; however, more clinical studies with adequate sample sizes and sound methodology are required to inform the development of evidence-based treatment guidelines.", "27534942": "Implications of the nutrition transition for vitamin D intake and status in Aboriginal groups in the Canadian Arctic.\nAboriginal Canadians have low intakes of vitamin D and are shifting away from consumption of traditional foods. Higher body mass index, skin pigmentation, and geographic latitude of residence further predispose Canadian Aboriginal populations to low vitamin D status. Low vitamin D status could compromise bone health and other health outcomes. Studies assessing vitamin D status of different Aboriginal groups are limited. The aim of this review is to examine the literature on vitamin D status and intakes of Canadian Aboriginal populations living in the Arctic. PubMed was searched for relevant articles published from 1983 to 2013. The prevalence of 25-hydroxy vitamin D deficiency ranged from 13.9% to 76.0% among children and adults in the summer. Furthermore, mean vitamin D intakes among all age groups were below the estimated average requirement. As vitamin D deficiency has been recently associated with chronic diseases, and Aboriginal populations living in the Arctic are at high risk for low vitamin D status, their vitamin D status should be assessed regularly across seasons.", "27194308": "Vitamin D status of black and white Americans and changes in vitamin D metabolites after varied doses of vitamin D supplementation.\nBACKGROUND: Controversy exists over the disparate circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations between black and white Americans. OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether there are differences in total and directly measured free 25(OH)D concentrations between black and white American adults and how daily supplementation with cholecalciferol changes these concentrations. DESIGN: Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses were conducted with the use of data from 2 placebo-controlled, randomized trials at 2 academic medical centers in the United States: CaDDM (Calcium and Vitamin D in Type 2 Diabetes) and DDM2 (Vitamin D for Established Type 2 Diabetes). A total of 208 subjects with pre- or well-controlled diabetes with a mean age of 59.1 y and mean body mass index (BMI; in kg/m(2)) of 31.6 were randomly assigned to receive daily cholecalciferol supplementation at 1 of 2 doses (2000 or 4000 IU) or a matching placebo for 16 wk. We measured serum total 25(OH)D, vitamin D-binding protein (DBP) by 2 different immunoassays (with the use of monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies), parathyroid hormone, and albumin. Free 25(OH)D concentration was directly measured and calculated. RESULTS: Blacks had lower total 25(OH)D concentrations than whites [adjusted median: 20.3 ng/mL (95% CI: 16.2, 24.5 ng/mL) compared with 26.7 ng/mL (95% CI: 25.2, 28.1 ng/mL), respectively; P = 0.026)], and a higher proportion of blacks had total 25(OH)D concentrations <20 ng/mL (46% compared with 19%, respectively; P < 0.001). Directly measured free 25(OH)D concentrations were lower in blacks than in whites [adjusted median: 4.5 ng/mL (95% CI: 3.7, 5.4 ng/mL) compared with 5.7 ng/mL (95% CI: 5.4, 5.9 ng/mL), respectively; P = 0.044] and were strongly correlated with total 25(OH)D without an effect of race. DBP was lower in blacks when measured by the monoclonal but not the polyclonal antibody immunoassay. Cholecalciferol supplementation increased total and measured free 25(OH)D concentrations proportionally to the dose and without a difference between races. CONCLUSIONS: The relation between free and total 25(OH)D did not vary systematically by race in this multiracial population with pre- or well-controlled diabetes. The results need to be replicated in additional cohorts before concluding that the clinical assessment of vitamin D status in blacks and whites should follow a single standard.

Studies involving populations that still enjoy a rural way of life and with traits similar to the Paleolithic period reveal them to present a more robust, resistant and diverse gut microbiota, in comparison to highly industrialized civilizations. The human diet has expanded and broadened to include the consumption of high-calorie foods, particularly from animal sources such as game meat and eggs. For some time, authors have been alert to the fact that a modern lifestyle leads to reduced intake of beneficial bacteria, suggesting that nonpathogenic bacteria are being eradicated. Furthermore, therapeutic procedures, including the use of probiotics and prebiotics, have been proposed to lead to recovery of this microbiota, which is altered due to both the ageing process and lifestyle related aspects. Accordingly, this article aims to review the impact of human aging and modern lifestyle on gut microbiota, within an evolutionary, ecological, epidemiological and therapeutic context.", "27534639": "Statistical design considerations applicable to clinical trials of iodine supplementation in pregnant women who may be mildly iodine deficient.\nNo large, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of iodine supplementation in pregnant women in a region of mild or moderate iodine deficiency has been completed in which a primary outcome measure was an assessment of the neurobehavioral development of the offspring at age \u22652 y. In this article, I discuss considerations for the design of such a trial in a region of mild iodine deficiency, with a focus on statistical methods and approaches. Exposure and design issues include the ethics of using a placebo, the potential for overexposure to iodine, and the possibility of community randomization. The main scientific goal of the trial is important in determining the follow-up period. If the goal is to determine whether iodine supplementation during pregnancy improves neurobehavioral development in the offspring, then follow-up should continue until a reasonably reliable assessment can be conducted, which might be at age \u22652 y. Once the timing of assessment is decided, the impact of potential loss to follow-up should be considered so that appropriate statistical methods can be incorporated into the design. The minimum sample size can be calculated by using a sample size formula that incorporates noncompliance and assumes that a certain proportion of study participants do not have any outcome observed. To have sufficient power to detect a reasonably modest difference in neurobehavioral development scores using an assessment tool with an SD of 15, a large number of participants (>500/group) is required. The minimum adequate number of participants may be even larger (>1300/group) depending on the magnitude of the difference in outcome between the supplementation and placebo groups, the estimated proportion of the iodine-supplementation group that fails to take the supplement, and the estimated proportion of pregnancies that do not produce outcome measurements.", "28071925": "Gene editing and genetic engineering approaches for advanced probiotics: A review.\nThe applications of probiotics are significant and thus resulted in need of genome analysis of probiotic strains. Various omics methods and systems biology approaches enables us to understand and optimize the metabolic processes. These techniques have increased the researcher's attention towards gut microbiome and provided a new source for the revelation of uncharacterized biosynthetic pathways which enables novel metabolic engineering approaches. In recent years, the broad and quantitative analysis of modified strains relies on systems biology tools such as in silico design which are commonly used methods for improving strain performance. The genetic manipulation of probiotic microorganisms is crucial for defining their role in intestinal microbiota and exploring their beneficial properties. This review describes an overview of gene editing and systems biology approaches, highlighting the advent of omics methods which allows the study of new routes for studying probiotic bacteria.

Inadequate vitamin B-12 status during pregnancy and early childhood has been associated with adverse child health outcomes, including impaired cognitive development. However, the underlying mechanisms have not been elucidated. This review was conducted to examine the evidence that links vitamin B-12 and cognition in children. The search strategy resulted in 17 studies: 3 cross-sectional, 1 case-control, and 12 cohort studies, and 1 randomized trial. Cognitive processes assessed included attention, memory, and perception. Developmental outcomes, academic performance, and intelligence quotient were also considered. Despite the high prevalence of vitamin B-12 insufficiency and associated risk of adverse cognitive outcomes in children, to our knowledge, no studies to date have been conducted to examine the effects of vitamin B-12 supplementation on cognition in children.

The Mini Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (MRQLQ) is a validated tool used to measure quality of life in people experiencing allergies (0 = not troubled to 6 = extremely troubled). Probiotics may improve quality of life during allergy season by increasing the percentage of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and inducing tolerance.Objective: The objective of this study was to determine whether consuming Lactobacillus gasseri KS-13, Bifidobacterium bifidum G9-1, and B. longum MM-2 compared with placebo would result in beneficial effects on MRQLQ scores throughout allergy season in individuals who typically experience seasonal allergies. Secondary outcomes included changes in immune markers as part of a potential mechanism for changes in MRQLQ scores.Design: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel, randomized clinical trial, 173 participants (mean \u00b1 SEM: age 27 \u00b1 1 y) who self-identified as having seasonal allergies received either a probiotic (2 capsules/d, 1.5 billion colony-forming units/capsule) or placebo during spring allergy season for 8 wk. MRQLQ scores were collected weekly throughout the study. Fasting blood samples were taken from a subgroup (placebo, n = 37; probiotic, n = 35) at baseline and week 6 (predicted peak of pollen) to determine serum immunoglobulin (Ig) E concentrations and Treg percentages.Results: The probiotic group reported an improvement in the MRQLQ global score from baseline to pollen peak (-0.68 \u00b1 0.13) when compared with the placebo group (-0.19 \u00b1 0.14; P = 0.0092). Both serum total IgE and the percentage of Tregs increased from baseline to week 6, but changes were not different between groups.Conclusions: This combination probiotic improved rhinoconjunctivitis-specific quality of life during allergy season for healthy individuals with self-reported seasonal allergies; however, the associated mechanism is still unclear.

However, oral vitamin D supplementation does not lower LDL-cholesterol concentrations or raise HDL-cholesterol concentrations. This uncoupling between association and causation may result from a failure of oral vitamin D to mimic the effect of dermally synthesized vitamin D in response to ultraviolet type B (UVB) light.Objective: We tested the hypothesis that, in vitamin D-deficient adults, the replenishment of vitamin D with UVB exposure would lower LDL-cholesterol concentrations compared with the effect of oral vitamin D3 supplementation.Design: We performed a randomized clinical trial in vitamin D-deficient adults and compared vitamin D replenishment between subjects who received oral vitamin D3 (n = 60) and those who received narrow-band UVB exposure (n = 58) \u22646 mo.Results: There was no difference in the change from baseline LDL-cholesterol concentrations between oral vitamin D3 and UVB groups (difference in median of oral vitamin D3 minus that of UVB: 1.5 mg/dL; 95% CI: -5.0, 7.0 mg/dL). There were also no differences within groups or between groups for changes in total or HDL cholesterol or triglycerides. Transcriptional profiling of skin and blood, however, revealed significant upregulation of immune pathway signaling with oral vitamin D3 but significant downregulation with UVB.Conclusions: Correcting vitamin D deficiency with either oral vitamin D3 or UVB does not improve the lipid profile.

However, the effects of long-term treatment of humans with DHA and EPA on various epigenetic factors-such as DNA methylation, which controls messenger RNA generation-are poorly described.Objective: We wanted to determine the effects of 6 mo of dietary supplementation with an n-3 FA preparation rich in DHA on global DNA methylation of peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) and the relation to plasma EPA and DHA concentrations in Alzheimer disease (AD) patients.Design: In the present study, DNA methylation in four 5'-cytosine-phosphate-guanine-3' (CpG) sites of long interspersed nuclear element-1 repetitive sequences was assessed in a group of 63 patients (30 given the n-3 FA preparation and 33 given placebo) as an estimation of the global DNA methylation in blood cells. Patients originated from the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled OmegAD study, in which 174 AD patients received either 1.7 g DHA and 0.6 g EPA (the n-3 FA group) or placebo daily for 6 mo.Results: At 6 mo, the n-3 FA group displayed marked increases in DHA and EPA plasma concentrations (2.6- and 3.5-fold), as well as decreased methylation in 2 out of 4 CpG sites (P < 0.05 for all), respectively. This hypomethylation in CpG2 and CpG4 sites showed a reverse correlation to changes in plasma EPA concentration (r = -0.25, P = 0.045; and r = -0.26, P = 0.041, respectively), but not to changes in plasma DHA concentration, and were not related to apolipoprotein E-4 allele frequency.Conclusion: Supplementation with n-3 FA for 6 mo was associated with global DNA hypomethylation in PBLs.

Few modifiable risk factors for early menopause have been identified, but emerging data suggest that high vitamin D intake may reduce risk.Objective: We evaluated how intakes of vitamin D and calcium are associated with the incidence of early menopause in the prospective Nurses' Health Study II (NHS2).Design: Intakes of vitamin D and calcium from foods and supplements were measured every 4 y with the use of a food-frequency questionnaire. Cases of incident early menopause were identified from all participants who were premenopausal at baseline in 1991; over 1.13 million person-years, 2041 women reported having natural menopause before the age of 45 y. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to evaluate relations between intakes of vitamin D and calcium and incident early menopause while accounting for potential confounding factors.Results: After adjustment for age, smoking, and other factors, women with the highest intake of dietary vitamin D (quintile median: 528 IU/d) had a significant 17% lower risk of early menopause than women with the lowest intake [quintile median: 148 IU/d; HR: 0.83 (95% CI: 0.72, 0.95); P-trend = 0.03]. Dietary calcium intake in the highest quintile (median: 1246 mg/d) compared with the lowest (median: 556 mg/d) was associated with a borderline significantly lower risk of early menopause (HR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.76, 1.00; P-trend = 0.03). Associations were stronger for vitamin D and calcium from dairy sources than from nondairy dietary sources, whereas high supplement use was not associated with lower risk.Conclusions: Findings suggest that high intakes of dietary vitamin D and calcium may be modestly associated with a lower risk of early menopause. Further studies evaluating 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations, other dairy constituents, and early menopause are warranted.", "27422505": "Resveratrol: How Much Wine Do You Have to Drink to Stay Healthy?\nResveratrol is a naturally occurring stilbene endowed with multiple health-promoting effects. It is produced by certain plants including several dietary sources such as grapes, apples, raspberries, blueberries, plums, peanuts, and products derived therefrom (e.g., wine). Resveratrol can be isolated and purified from these biological sources or synthesized in a few steps with an overall high yield. This compound and its glucoside, the trans-polydatin piceid, have received worldwide attention for their beneficial effects on cardiovascular, inflammatory, neurodegenerative, metabolic, and age-related diseases. These health-promoting effects are particularly attractive given the prevalence of resveratrol-based nutraceuticals and the paradoxical epidemiologic observation that wine consumption is inversely correlated to the incidence of coronary heart disease. However, the notion of resveratrol as a \"magic bullet\" was recently challenged by clinical trials showing that this polyphenol does not have a substantial influence on health status and mortality risk. In the present review, we discuss the proposed therapeutic attributes and the mode of molecular actions of resveratrol. We also cover recent pharmacologic efforts to improve the poor bioavailability of resveratrol and influence the transition between body systems in humans. We conclude with some thoughts about future research directions that might be meaningful for resolving controversies surrounding resveratrol.", "27707701": "Moderate folic acid supplementation and MTHFD1-synthetase deficiency in mice, a model for the R653Q variant, result in embryonic defects and abnormal placental development.\nBACKGROUND: Moderately high folic acid intake in pregnant women has led to concerns about deleterious effects on the mother and fetus. Common polymorphisms in folate genes, such as methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase-methenyltetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase-formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase (MTHFD1) R653Q, may modulate the effects of elevated folic acid intake. OBJECTIVES: We investigated the effects of moderate folic acid supplementation on reproductive outcomes and assessed the potential interaction of the supplemented diet with MTHFD1-synthetase (Mthfd1S) deficiency in mice, which is a model for the R653Q variant. DESIGN: Female Mthfd1S+/+ and Mthfd1S+/- mice were fed a folic acid-supplemented diet (FASD) (5-fold higher than recommended) or control diets before mating and during pregnancy. Embryos and placentas were assessed for developmental defects at embryonic day 10.5 (E10.5). Maternal folate and choline metabolites and gene expression in folate-related pathways were examined. RESULTS: The combination of FASD and maternal MTHFD1-synthetase deficiency led to a greater incidence of defects in E10.5 embryos (diet \u00d7 maternal genotype, P = 0.0016; diet \u00d7 embryonic genotype, P = 0.054). The methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) protein and methylation potential [ratio of S-adenosylmethionine (major methyl donor):S-adenosylhomocysteine) were reduced in maternal liver. Although 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (methylTHF) was higher in maternal circulation, the methylation potential was lower in embryos. The presence of developmental delays and defects in Mthfd1S+/- embryos was associated with placental defects (P = 0.003). The labyrinth layer failed to form properly in the majority of abnormal placentas, which compromised the integration of the maternal and fetal circulation and presumably the transfer of methylTHF and other nutrients. CONCLUSIONS: Moderately higher folate intake and MTHFD1-synthetase deficiency in pregnant mice result in a lower methylation potential in maternal liver and embryos and a greater incidence of defects in embryos. Although maternal circulating methylTHF was higher, it may not have reached the embryos because of abnormal placental development; abnormal placentas were observed predominantly in abnormally developed embryos. These findings have implications for women with high folate intakes, particularly if they are polymorphic for MTHFD1 R653Q.", "26864368": "Including whey protein and whey permeate in ready-to-use supplementary food improves recovery rates in children with moderate acute malnutrition: a randomized, double-blind clinical trial.\nBACKGROUND: The utility of dairy ingredients in the supplementary foods used in the treatment of childhood moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) remains unsettled. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the effectiveness of a peanut-based ready-to-use supplementary food (RUSF) with soy protein compared with a novel RUSF containing dairy ingredients in the form of whey permeate and whey protein concentrate in the treatment of children with MAM. DESIGN: We conducted a randomized, double-blind clinical effectiveness trial involving rural Malawian and Mozambican children 6-59 mo of age with MAM treated with either soy RUSF or a novel whey RUSF treatment of ~75 kcal \u00b7 kg(-1) \u00b7 d(-1) for up to 12 wk. RESULTS: The proportion of children that recovered from MAM was significantly higher in the group that received whey RUSF (960 of 1144; 83.9%) than in the group that received soy RUSF (874 of 1086; 80.5%; P < 0.04; risk difference 3.4%, 95% CI: 0.3%, 6.6%). Children who consumed whey RUSF also demonstrated better growth markers, with a higher mean midupper arm circumference (MUAC) at the time of discharge (P < 0.009), greater MUAC gain during the course of treatment (P < 0.003), higher mean weight-for-height z score at discharge (P < 0.008), and greater weight gain (P < 0.05). No significant differences were identified in length gain or time to recovery between the 2 groups. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the importance of milk protein in the treatment of MAM, because the use of a novel whey RUSF resulted in higher recovery rates and improved growth than did soy RUSF, although the whey RUSF supplement provided less total protein and energy than the soy RUSF.

A total of 361 nonpregnant women (age 18-35 y) were recruited from 10 sites within Mumbai and Navi Mumbai, India. All participants received anemia education and a complete blood count (CBC). Random assignment of anemic participants to intervention and control arms occurred within 5 matched site-pairs. Intervention participants received 1 iron-supplement bar (containing 14 mg Fe)/d for 90 d, whereas control subjects received nothing. CBC tests were given at days 15, 45, and 90. Primary outcomes were 90-d changes from baseline in hemoglobin concentrations and hematocrit percentages. Linear mixed models and generalized estimating equations were used to model continuous and binary outcomes, respectively.Results: Of 179 anemic participants, 136 (76.0%) completed all follow-up assessments (65 intervention and 71 control participants). Baseline characteristics were comparable by arm. Mean hemoglobin and hematocrit increases after 90 d were greater for intervention than for control participants [1.4 g/dL (95% CI: 1.3, 1.6 g/dL) and 2.7% (95% CI: 2.2%, 3.2%), respectively]. The anemia prevalence at 90 d was lower for intervention (29.2%) than for control participants (98.6%) (OR: 0.007; 95% CI: 0.001, 0.04).Conclusions: The daily consumption of an iron-supplement bar leads to increased hemoglobin concentrations and hematocrit percentages and to a lower anemia prevalence in the target population with no reported side effects. This intervention is an attractive option to combat anemia in India. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02032615.", "27030533": "DHA supplementation during pregnancy does not reduce BMI or body fat mass in children: follow-up of the DHA to Optimize Mother Infant Outcome randomized controlled trial.\nBACKGROUND: The omega-3 (n-3) long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LCPUFA) docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) has proven effective at reducing fat storage in animal studies. However, a systematic review of human trials showed a lack of quality data to support or refute this hypothesis. OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether maternal DHA supplementation during the second half of pregnancy results in a lower body mass index (BMI) and percentage of body fat in children. DESIGN: We conducted a follow-up at 3 and 5 y of age of children who were born to mothers enrolled in the DOMInO (DHA to Optimize Mother Infant Outcome) double-blind, randomized controlled trial, in which women with a singleton pregnancy were provided with DHA-rich fish-oil capsules (800 mg DHA/d) or vegetable-oil capsules (control group) in the second half of pregnancy. Primary outcomes were the BMI z score and percentage of body fat at 3 and 5 y of age. Potential interactions between prenatal DHA and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) genotype as a measure of the genetic predisposition to obesity were investigated. RESULTS: A total of 1614 children were eligible for the follow-up. Parent or caregiver consent was obtained for 1531 children (95%), and these children were included in the analysis. BMI z scores and percentages of body fat of children in the DHA group did not differ from those of children in the control group at either 3 y of age [BMI z score adjusted mean difference: 0.03 (95% CI: -0.07, 0.13; P = 0.61); percentage of body fat adjusted mean difference: -0.26 (95% CI: -0.99, 0.46; P = 0.47)] or 5 y of age [BMI z score adjusted mean difference: 0.02 (95% CI: -0.08, 0.12; P = 0.66); percentage of body fat adjusted mean difference: 0.11 (95% CI: -0.60, 0.82; P = 0.75)]. No treatment effects were modified by the PPAR\u03b3 genotype of the child. CONCLUSION: Independent of a genetic predisposition to obesity, maternal intake of DHA-rich fish oil during the second half of pregnancy does not affect the growth or body composition of children at 3 or 5 y of age.

The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review of the literature on the effect of diet on asthma management in adults. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, and Scopus (January 1948-October 2014) for randomized clinical trials that evaluated the effects of diet in adults with asthma. RESULTS: Of 12,215 studies identified, 21 were included. A reduction in weight of at least 7.5% from baseline as a result of caloric restriction can be beneficial for improving disease control, quality of life, and pulmonary function in obese patients with asthma. A dietary pattern rich in foods with potential antioxidant effect had an impact in improving asthma control, but with little clinical significance. Studies involving antioxidant supplementation showed improvements in asthma control with magnesium supplementation and less decline in lung function with vitamin C supplementation. Studies of fatty acid supplementation demonstrated effects on weight loss and improvement of asthma control and lung function. Studies of supplementation with propolis and caffeine reported significant increases in FEV1. Conversely, studies of high dietary salt intake reported greater declines in lung function. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence shows that, for obese adults with asthma, the best dietary intervention seems to be caloric restriction, regardless of specific dietary components.", "28140326": "Altered Transport and Metabolism of Phenolic Compounds in Obesity and Diabetes: Implications for Functional Food Development and Assessment.\nInterest in the application of phenolic compounds from the diet or supplements for the prevention of chronic diseases has grown substantially, but the efficacy of such approaches in humans is largely dependent on the bioavailability and metabolism of these compounds. Although food and dietary factors have been the focus of intense investigation, the impact of disease states such as obesity or diabetes on their absorption, metabolism, and eventual efficacy is important to consider. These factors must be understood in order to develop effective strategies that leverage bioactive phenolic compounds for the prevention of chronic disease. The goal of this review is to discuss the inducible metabolic systems that may be influenced by disease states and how these effects impact the bioavailability and metabolism of dietary phenolic compounds. Because current studies generally report that obesity and/or diabetes alter the absorption and excretion of these compounds, this review includes a description of the absorption, conjugation, and excretion pathways for phenolic compounds and how they are potentially altered in disease states. A possible mechanism that will be discussed related to the modulation of phenolic bioavailability and metabolism may be linked to increased inflammatory status from increased amounts of adipose tissue or elevated plasma glucose concentrations. Although more studies are needed, the translation of benefits derived from dietary phenolic compounds to individuals with obesity or diabetes may require the consideration of dosing strategies or be accompanied by adjunct therapies to improve the bioavailability of these compounds.", "28468891": "The effect of lipids, a lipid-rich ready-to-use therapeutic food, or a phytase on iron absorption from maize-based meals fortified with micronutrient powders.\nBackground: Ready-to-use-therapeutic foods (RUTFs) high in lipid, protein, and iron are used to treat malnutrition. Lipids increase gastric residence time, which could increase iron absorption, particularly from poorly soluble iron compounds and in combination with phytase.Objectives: The objectives were to 1) assess the effect on iron absorption of a lipid emulsion given 20 min before or together with an iron-fortified maize meal and 2) assess iron absorption from a micronutrient powder (MNP) given with a nutrient-dense RUTF and/or a microbial phytase.Design: A total of 41 women participated in 3 studies. They consumed a maize meal fortified with isotopically labeled ferrous sulfate (FeSO4; study 1) or ferric pyrophosphate (FePP; study 2). In studies 1 and 2, a lipid emulsion was given with or 20 min before the meal. In study 3, with the use of a 2 \u00d7 2 factorial design, subjects consumed a maize meal fortified with an MNP containing labeled FeSO4 (MNP) given with an RUTF (MNP+RUTF), with a phytase (MNP+phytase), or both (MNP+RUTF+phytase). Iron absorption was assessed by isotope incorporation in erythrocytes 14 d after the test meals.Results: The lipid emulsion given either before or with the meal significantly increased iron absorption from FePP by 2.55-fold (95% CI: 1.48-, 4.37-fold; P = 0.001) but not from FeSO4 There was a trend to increase iron absorption with the MNP+RUTF meal, which did not reach significance (1.21-fold; 95% CI: 0.92-, 1.61-fold; P = 0.060). The addition of phytase to MNP and MNP+RUTF significantly increased iron absorption by 1.85-fold (95% CI: 1.49-, 2.29-fold; P < 0.001), with no interaction between phytase and RUTF.Conclusions: In iron-fortified maize-based meals, the addition of lipids more than doubles iron absorption from FePP. Our results suggest the possibility of an enhancing effect on iron absorption of lipid-rich RUTFs, but more research is needed to determine this.

Supplementation of large neutral amino acids (LNAAs) has been suggested as an alternative dietary treatment strategy to optimize neurocognitive outcome in phenylketonuria and has been shown to influence 3 brain pathobiochemical mechanisms in phenylketonuria, but its optimal composition has not been established. OBJECTIVE: In order to provide additional pathobiochemical insight and develop optimal LNAA treatment, several targeted LNAA supplements were investigated with respect to all 3 biochemical disturbances underlying brain dysfunction in phenylketonuria. DESIGN: Pah-enu2 (PKU) mice received 1 of 5 different LNAA-supplemented diets beginning at postnatal day 45. Control groups included phenylketonuria mice receiving an isonitrogenic and isocaloric high-protein diet or the AIN-93M diet, and wild-type mice receiving the AIN-93M diet. After 6 wk, brain and plasma amino acid profiles and brain monoaminergic neurotransmitter concentrations were measured. RESULTS: Brain Phe concentrations were most effectively reduced by supplementation of LNAAs, such as Leu and Ile, with a strong affinity for the LNAA transporter type 1. Brain non-Phe LNAAs could be restored on supplementation, but unbalanced LNAA supplementation further reduced brain concentrations of those LNAAs that were not (sufficiently) included in the LNAA supplement. To optimally ameliorate brain monoaminergic neurotransmitter concentrations, LNAA supplementation should include Tyr and Trp together with LNAAs that effectively reduce brain Phe concentrations. The requirement for Tyr supplementation is higher than it is for Trp, and the relative effect of brain Phe reduction is higher for serotonin than it is for dopamine and norepinephrine. CONCLUSION: The study shows that all 3 biochemical disturbances underlying brain dysfunction in phenylketonuria can be targeted by specific LNAA supplements. The study thus provides essential information for the development of optimal LNAA supplementation as an alternative dietary treatment strategy to optimize neurocognitive outcome in patients with phenylketonuria.", "27246190": "Exopolysaccharides produced by Lactobacillus sp.: Biosynthesis and applications.\nLactobacillus sp. synthesize exopolysaccharides (EPS), including both homo- and heteropolysaccharides, which play an important role in the production of fermented foods, and especially in the dairy industry, improving the gustatory and rheological properties of the finished products. These polymers are generated by starter cultures in situ in fermented foods, and so they are treated as natural thickening agents. As some Lactobacillus strains are generally recognized as safe and have been shown to exhibit probiotic activity, EPS from those bacteria can be used as functional food ingredients, conferring both health and economic benefits to the consumers. However, their industrial applications are hindered by the low yield of EPS from Lactobacillus and high costs of their purification.

Despite the recognition of this critical period, there have been few evaluations of the growth impact of interventions that cover most of this window.Objective: We evaluated home fortification approaches for preventing maternal and child undernutrition within a community-based health program. We hypothesized that small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplements (LNSs) provided to women during pregnancy and the first 6 mo postpartum, LNSs provided to their offspring from 6 to 24 mo of age, or both would result in greater child length-for-age z score (LAZ) at 24 mo than iron and folic acid (IFA) provided to women during pregnancy and postpartum plus micronutrient powder (MNP) or no supplementation for their offspring from 6 to 24 mo.Design: We conducted a cluster-randomized effectiveness trial with 4 arms: 1) women and children both received LNSs (LNS-LNS group), 2) women received IFA and children received LNSs (IFA-LNS group), 3) women received IFA and children received MNP (IFA-MNP group), and 4) women received IFA and children received no supplements (IFA-Control group). We enrolled 4011 women at \u226420 wk of gestation within 64 clusters, each comprising the supervision area of a community health worker. Analyses were primarily performed by using ANCOVA F tests and Tukey-Kramer-corrected pairwise comparisons.Results: At 24 mo, the LNS-LNS group had significantly higher LAZ (+0.13 compared with the IFA-MNP group) and head circumference (+0.15 z score compared with the IFA-Control group); these outcomes did not differ between the other groups. Stunting prevalence (LAZ <-2) was lower in the LNS-LNS group at 18 mo than in the IFA-MNP group (OR: 0.70; 95% CI: 0.53, 0.92), but the difference diminished by 24 mo (OR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.63, 1.04).Conclusion: Home fortification with small-quantity LNSs, but not MNP, during the first 1000 d improved child linear growth and head size in rural Bangladesh.

OBJECTIVE: This study tested the hypothesis that nutritional supplementation with whey protein (22 g), essential amino acids (10.9 g, including 4 g leucine), and vitamin D [2.5 \u03bcg (100 IU)] concurrent with regular, controlled physical activity would increase fat-free mass, strength, physical function, and quality of life, and reduce the risk of malnutrition in sarcopenic elderly persons. DESIGN: A total of 130 sarcopenic elderly people (53 men and 77 women; mean age: 80.3 y) participated in a 12-wk randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled supplementation trial. All participants concurrently took part in a controlled physical activity program. We examined body composition with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, muscle strength with a handgrip dynamometer, and blood biochemical indexes of nutritional and health status, and evaluated global nutritional status, physical function, and quality of life before and after the 12 wk of intervention. RESULTS: Compared with physical activity and placebo, supplementation plus physical activity increased fat-free mass (1.7-kg gain, P < 0.001), relative skeletal muscle mass (P = 0.009), android distribution of fat (P = 0.021), handgrip strength (P = 0.001), standardized summary scores for physical components (P = 0.030), activities of daily living (P = 0.001), mini nutritional assessment (P = 0.003), and insulin-like growth factor I (P = 0.002), and lowered C-reactive protein (P = 0.038). CONCLUSION: Supplementation with whey protein, essential amino acids, and vitamin D, in conjunction with age-appropriate exercise, not only boosts fat-free mass and strength but also enhances other aspects that contribute to well-being in sarcopenic elderly.

OBJECTIVE: We sought to investigate whether vitamin D at doses higher than currently recommended decreases indexes of IR in an ambulatory population of overweight elderly subjects. DESIGN: This double-blind, randomized, controlled multicenter trial enrolled 257 elderly overweight individuals aged \u226565 y with baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations between 10 and 30 ng/mL. All subjects received 1000 mg calcium citrate/d, with vitamin D administered weekly at an equivalent dose of 600 or 3750 IU/d. The homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) of IR index at 1 y was the primary outcome. We also assessed the McAuley index. RESULTS: In total, 222 subjects (55% women) with a mean \u00b1 SD age and body mass index (BMI; in kg/m(2)) of 71 \u00b1 4 y and 30 \u00b1 4, respectively, completed the study. Subjects' baseline characteristics, including IR indexes, were similar across groups: 69% had prediabetes, 54% had hypertension (47% were taking antihypertensive medications), and 60% had hyperlipidemia, nearly half of whom were receiving lipid-lowering drugs. At 1 y, mean \u00b1 SD serum 25(OH)D increased from 20 \u00b1 7 to 26 \u00b1 7 ng/mL in the low-dose arm (P < 0.0001) and from 21 \u00b1 8 to 36 \u00b1 10 ng/mL in the high-dose arm (P < 0.001). Median HOMA-IR indexes did not change compared with baseline concentrations and were similar in the high- [2.2 (IQR: 1.5, 2.9)] and low-dose [2.3 (IQR: 1.6, 3.3] treatment groups. Adjusted analyses showed that HOMA-IR was predicted by the baseline HOMA index and BMI but not by vitamin D dose, baseline serum 25(OH)D, or change in 25(OH)D. CONCLUSION: Vitamin D3 at 3750 IU/d did not improve HOMA-IR compared with the Institute of Medicine Recommended Dietary Allowance of 600 IU/d in elderly overweight individuals.

Potatoes provide 19-20% of potassium in the American diet. OBJECTIVE: We compared the bioavailability and dose response of potassium from nonfried white potatoes with skin [targeted at 20, 40, and 60 milliequivalents (mEq) K] and French fries (40 mEq K) with potassium gluconate at the same doses when added to a basal diet that contained \u223c60 mEq K. DESIGN: Thirty-five healthy, normotensive men and women with a mean \u00b1 SD age of 29.7 \u00b1 11.2 y and body mass index (in kg/m(2)) of 24.3 \u00b1 4.4 were enrolled in a single-blind, crossover, randomized controlled trial. Participants were partially randomly assigned to the order of testing for nine 5-d interventions of additional potassium as follows: 0 (control; repeated at phases 1 and 5), 20, 40, and 60 mEq K/d consumed as a potassium gluconate supplement or as unfried potato or 40 mEq K from French fries completed at phase 9. The bioavailability of potassium was determined from the area under the curve (AUC) of serial blood draws and cumulative urinary excretion during a 24-h period and from a kinetic analysis. The effects of the potassium source and dose on the change in blood pressure and augmentation index (AIx) were determined. RESULTS: The serum potassium AUC increased with the dose (P < 0.0001) and did not differ because of the source (P = 0.53). Cumulative 24-h urinary potassium also increased with the dose (P < 0.0001) and was greater with the potato than with the supplement (P < 0.0001). The kinetic analysis showed the absorption efficiency was high across all interventions (>94% \u00b1 12%). There were no significant differences in the change in blood pressure or AIx with the treatment source or dose. CONCLUSIONS: The bioavailability of potassium is as high from potatoes as from potassium gluconate supplements. Future studies that measure the effect of dietary potassium on blood pressure will need to evaluate the effect of various dietary sources on potassium retention and in both normal and hypertensive populations.

There are as many as 50,000 secondary metabolites that may influence human health. Their structural and chemical diversity presents a challenge to analytical chemistry. With respect to flavonoids, putative identification is accessible, but positive identification and quantification are limited by the lack of standards. Quantification has been tested with use of both nonspecific and specific methods. Nonspecific methods, which include antioxidant capacity methods, fail to provide information on the measured components, suffer from numerous interferences, are not equatable, and are unsuitable for health research. Specific methods, such as LC with diode array and mass spectrometric detection, require the use of internal standards and relative molar response factors. These methods are relatively expensive and require a high level of expertise and experimental verification; however, they represent the only suitable means of relating health outcomes to specific dietary components.", "27604769": "Effects of prenatal multiple micronutrient supplementation on growth and cognition through 2 y of age in rural Bangladesh: the JiVitA-3 Trial.\nBACKGROUND: Childhood undernutrition may have prenatal origins, and the impact of prenatal interventions on postnatal growth is not well known. OBJECTIVE: We assessed the effects of prenatal multiple micronutrient (MM) supplementation on child growth and cognitive development. DESIGN: In a cluster-randomized controlled trial in rural Bangladesh, prenatal MM supplementation compared with iron-folic acid (IFA) supplementation was examined for its impact on growth assessed longitudinally from birth up to 24 mo of age (n = 8529) and, in a subsample (n = 734), on cognitive function at 24 mo of age by use of the Bayley scales of infant and toddler development-third edition test. RESULTS: Prevalence of stunting at birth [length for age z score (LAZ): <-2] was 31.9% in the MM and 35.7% in the IFA groups (P < 0.001); however, LAZ increased during the first 3-4 mo in both groups. With the use of a linear random-effects model, prenatal MM-exposed children sustained a higher mean predicted LAZ of \u223c0.10 at 1 and 3 mo and 0.06 at 6 mo of age compared with children in the IFA group. Supplementation reduced the prevalence of stunting at 1 (RR: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.92, 0.98) and 3 (RR: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.88, 0.94) mo of age. Differences between groups were absent by 6, 12, and 24 mo of age, when nearly 50% of children had stunted growth. Ponderal and linear growth velocities were somewhat slower from 3 to 12 mo of age in the MM group than in the IFA group, but not from 12 to 24 mo of age. There was no difference between groups on composite scores of cognition, language, and motor performance at 24 mo of age. CONCLUSIONS: In this Bangladeshi trial, maternal pre- and postnatal MM supplementation resulted in improvements in LAZ and reduction in stunting through 3 mo of age, but not thereafter and had no impact on cognitive and motor function at 2 y.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this evidence-based review was to examine whether supplementation with l-arginine, in combination with caffeine and/or creatine, is safe and whether it enhances athletic performance or improves recovery from exhaustion for military personnel. DATA SOURCES: Information from clinical trials and adverse event reports were collected from 17 databases and 5 adverse event report portals. STUDY SELECTION: Studies and reports were included if they evaluated the safety and the putative outcomes of enhanced performance or improved recovery from exhaustion associated with the intake of arginine alone or in combination with caffeine and/or creatine in healthy adults aged 19 to 50 years. DATA EXTRACTION: Information related to population, intervention, comparator, and outcomes was abstracted. Of the 2687 articles screened, 62 articles meeting the inclusion criteria were analyzed. Strength of evidence was assessed in terms of risk of bias, consistency, directness, and precision. RESULTS: Most studies had few participants and suggested risk of bias that could negatively affect the results. l-Arginine supplementation provided little enhancement of athletic performance or improvements in recovery. Short-term supplementation with arginine may result in adverse gastrointestinal and cardiovascular effects. No information about the effects of arginine on the performance of military personnel was available. CONCLUSIONS: The available information does not support the use of l-arginine, either alone or in combination with caffeine, creatine, or both, to enhance athletic performance or improve recovery from exhaustion. Given the information gaps, an evidence-based review to assess the safety or effectiveness of multi-ingredient dietary supplements was not feasible, and therefore the development of a computational model-based approach to predict the safety of multi-ingredient dietary supplements is recommended.", "27534629": "Development of Standard Reference Materials to support assessment of iodine status for nutritional and public health purposes.\nThe use of urinary iodine as an indicator of iodine status relies in part on the accuracy of the analytical measurement of iodine in urine. Likewise, the use of dietary iodine intake as an indicator of iodine status relies in part on the accuracy of the analytical measurement of iodine in dietary sources, including foods and dietary supplements. Similarly, the use of specific serum biomarkers of thyroid function to screen for both iodine deficiency and iodine excess relies in part on the accuracy of the analytical measurement of those biomarkers. The National Institute of Standards and Technology has been working with the NIH Office of Dietary Supplements for several years to develop higher-order reference measurement procedures and Standard Reference Materials to support the validation of new routine analytical methods for iodine in foods and dietary supplements, for urinary iodine, and for several serum biomarkers of thyroid function including thyroid-stimulating hormone, thyroglobulin, total and free thyroxine, and total and free triiodothyronine. These materials and methods have the potential to improve the assessment of iodine status and thyroid function in observational studies and clinical trials, thereby promoting public health efforts related to iodine nutrition.", "27534628": "Suggested use of sensitive measures of memory to detect functional effects of maternal iodine supplementation on hippocampal development.\nMaternal hypothyroxinemia secondary to iodine deficiency may have neurodevelopmental effects on the specific neurocognitive domain of memory. Associated disruption of thyroid hormone-dependent protein synthesis in the hippocampus has the potential to result in compromised development of the structure with consequential impairments in memory function. Despite links between maternal iodine deficiency during gestation and lactation and abnormal hippocampal development in rat fetuses and pups, there has been little research on the specific function of memory in human infants and young children born to iodine-deficient mothers. Several candidate measures have proven to be sensitive to the effects of gestational iron deficiency on memory function in infants and young children, including habituation and dishabituation, imitation-based tasks, and event-related potentials. Such measures could be used to test the effects of maternal iodine supplementation on the specific neurocognitive domain of memory in infants and young children. Furthermore, progress in understanding the effects of maternal iodine supplementation on neurocognitive development could be accelerated by the development of a nonhuman primate model to complement the rodent model.", "28399577": "Drug-development concepts as guides for optimizing clinical trials of supplemental zinc for populations at risk of deficiency or diarrhea.\nStudies on the efficacy of zinc supplementation for treatment or prevention of diarrhea have shown an inconsistent effect in populations at risk for zinc deficiency. Unlike drugs, which have no preexisting presence in the body, endogenous zinc must be assessed pharmacokinetically by isotope tracer studies. Although such methods have produced much data, very few studies have estimated the dose and the timing of dosing of zinc supplementation. This review examines drug kinetics used to establish the best dose, the timing of such doses, and the mechanism of action through pharmacodynamic markers and applies them, where possible, to zinc supplements. The findings reveal that little is known, especially in children at highest risk of zinc deficiency. Key data missing to inform proper dosing, whether for treatment of disease or for preventive nutrient supplementation, are noted. Addressing these uncertainties could improve study design, leading to future studies of zinc supplements that might be of greater benefit.", "28228425": "Prebiotic supplementation improves appetite control in children with overweight and obesity: a randomized controlled trial.\nBackground: Prebiotics have been shown to improve satiety in adults with overweight and obesity; however, studies in children are limited.Objective: We examined the effects of prebiotic supplementation on appetite control and energy intake in children with overweight and obesity.Design: This study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Forty-two boys and girls, ages 7-12 y, with a body mass index (BMI) of \u226585th percentile were randomly assigned to 8 g oligofructose-enriched inulin/d or placebo (maltodextrin) for 16 wk. Objective measures of appetite included energy intake at an ad libitum breakfast buffet, 3-d food records, and fasting satiety hormone concentrations. Subjective appetite ratings were obtained from visual analog scales before and after the breakfast. Children's Eating Behavior Questionnaires were also completed by caregivers.Results: Compared with placebo, prebiotic intake resulted in significantly higher feelings of fullness (P = 0.04) and lower prospective food consumption (P = 0.03) at the breakfast buffet at 16 wk compared with baseline. Compared with placebo, prebiotic supplementation significantly reduced energy intake at the week 16 breakfast buffet in 11- and 12-y-olds (P = 0.04) but not in 7- to 10-y-olds. Fasting adiponectin (P = 0.04) and ghrelin (P = 0.03) increased at 16 wk with the prebiotic compared with placebo. In intent-to-treat analysis, there was a trend for prebiotic supplementation to reduce BMI z score to a greater extent than placebo (-3.4%; P = 0.09) and a significant -3.8% reduction in per-protocol analysis (P = 0.043).Conclusions: Independent of other lifestyle changes, prebiotic supplementation in children with overweight and obesity improved subjective appetite ratings. This translated into reduced energy intake in a breakfast buffet in older but not in younger children. This simple dietary change has the potential to help with appetite regulation in children with obesity.

Key factors driving the metabolic syndrome are inflammation, oxidative stress, insulin resistance (IR), and obesity. IR is defined as the impairment of insulin to achieve its physiological effects, resulting in glucose and lipid metabolic dysfunction in tissues such as muscle, fat, kidney, liver, and pancreatic \u03b2-cells. The potential of rooibos extract and its major C-glucosyl flavonoids, in particular aspalathin, a C-glucoside dihydrochalcone, as well as the phenolic precursor, Z-2-(\u03b2-D-glucopyranosyloxy)-3-phenylpropenoic acid, to prevent the metabolic syndrome, will be highlighted. The mechanisms whereby these phenolic compounds elicit positive effects on inflammation, cellular oxidative stress and transcription factors that regulate the expression of genes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism will be discussed in terms of their potential in ameliorating features of the metabolic syndrome and the development of serious metabolic disease. An overview of the phenolic composition of rooibos and the changes during processing will provide relevant background on this herbal tea, while a discussion of the bioavailability of the major rooibos C-glucosyl flavonoids will give insight into a key aspect of the bioefficacy of rooibos.", "27431368": "Formate: The Neglected Member of One-Carbon Metabolism.\nFormate, the only non-tetrahydrofolate (THF)-linked intermediate in one-carbon metabolism, is produced in mammals from a variety of metabolic sources. It occurs in serum of adults at a concentration of approximately 30 \u03bcM. Its principal function lies as a source of one-carbon groups for the synthesis of 10-formyl-THF and other one-carbon intermediates; these are primarily used for purine synthesis, thymidylate synthesis, and the provision of methyl groups for synthetic, regulatory, and epigenetic methylation reactions. Although formate is largely produced in mitochondria, these functions mostly occur in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Formate plays a significant role in embryonic development, as evidenced by the effectiveness of formate in the pregnant dam's drinking water on the incidence of neural tube defects in some genetic models. High formate concentrations in fetal lambs may indicate a role in fetal development and suggest that extracellular formate may play a role in the interorgan distribution of one-carbon groups.", "28541582": "Definition of a tolerable upper intake level of niacin: a systematic review and meta-analysis of the dose-dependent effects of nicotinamide and nicotinic acid supplementation.\nContext: Nicotinic acid and nicotinamide are soluble compounds of the vitamin B group, widely used to regulate the lipid profile in hyperlipidemic individuals. Higher doses of nicotinic acid are associated with adverse effects, especially flushing. A unique tolerable upper intake level (UL) of nicotinic acid has not been defined. Objective: This meta-analysis aims to evaluate adverse effects and their incidence after supplementation with different doses of nicotinic acid and nicotinamide, comparing results with current ULs in Europe and the United States. Data Sources: PubMed was searched for articles providing detailed information about nicotinic acid or nicotinamide supplementation and related outcomes. Study Selection: A total of 2670 citations were selected for screening. Two primary outcomes were considered: occurrence of adverse effects following nicotinic acid or nicotinamide supplementation, and dose at which adverse effects occurred. Data extraction: Details on study population, type and duration of treatment, dosage of vitamins, association with lipid-influencing drugs, length of follow-up, and incidence and type of adverse events were extracted. Results: After screening, 47 articles involving 11\u2005741 individuals were included. Meta-analysis was based on estimation of benchmark doses for the probability of adverse effects after supplementation. In individuals with dyslipidemia or cardiovascular disease, nicotinic acid monotherapy seems to be protective against any adverse effects considered, as adverse events occurred at doses above those used with other treatments. In healthy individuals treated with nicotinic acid alone, major adverse effects occurred at doses below 1000\u2009mg/d. Conclusions: Results may indicate a high degree of conservativeness in the UL of nicotinic acid, fixed at 35\u2009mg/d in United States and 10\u2009mg/d in Europe. Reconsideration of the UL of nicotinic acid for nutritional supplements, possibly differentiating between ULs in healthy and unhealthy individuals, may be warranted.", "27261273": "Chromium supplements for glycemic control in type 2 diabetes: limited evidence of effectiveness.\nSome adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) believe that chromium-containing supplements will help control their disease, but the evidence is mixed. This narrative review examines the efficacy of chromium supplements for improving glycemic control as measured by decreases in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) or hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). Using systematic search criteria, 20 randomized controlled trials of chromium supplementation in T2DM patients were identified. Clinically meaningful treatment goals were defined as an FPG of \u22647.2\u2009mmol/dL, a decline in HbA1c to \u22647%, or a decrease of \u22650.5% in HbA1c. In only a few randomized controlled trials did FPG (5 of 20), HbA1c (3 of 14), or both (1 of 14) reach the treatment goals with chromium supplementation. HbA1c declined by \u22650.5% in 5 of 14 studies. On the basis of the low strength of existing evidence, chromium supplements have limited effectiveness, and there is little rationale to recommend their use for glycemic control in patients with existing T2DM. Future meta-analyses should include only high-quality studies with similar forms of chromium and comparable inclusion/exclusion criteria to provide scientifically sound recommendations for clinicians.", "28768650": "Intake of niacin, folate, vitamin B-6, and vitamin B-12 through young adulthood and cognitive function in midlife: the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study.\nBackground: Epidemiologic evidence regarding niacin, folate, vitamin B-6, and vitamin B-12 intake in relation to cognitive function is limited, especially in midlife.Objective: We hypothesize that higher intake of these B vitamins in young adulthood is associated with better cognition later in life.Design: This study comprised a community-based multicenter cohort of black and white men and women aged 18-30 y in 1985-1986 (year 0, i.e., baseline) from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study (n = 3136). We examined participants' CARDIA diet history at years 0, 7, and 20 to assess nutrient intake, including dietary and supplemental B vitamins. We measured cognitive function at year 25 (mean \u00b1 SD age: 50 \u00b1 4 y) through the use of the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) for verbal memory, the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) for psychomotor speed, and a modified Stroop interference test for executive function. Higher RAVLT and DSST scores and a lower Stroop score indicated better cognitive function. We used multivariable-adjusted linear regressions to estimate mean differences in cognitive scores and 95% CIs.Results: Comparing the highest quintile with the lowest (quintile 5 compared with quintile 1), cumulative total intake of niacin was significantly associated with 3.92 more digits on the DSST (95% CI: 2.28, 5.55; P-trend < 0.01) and 1.89 points lower interference score on the Stroop test (95% CI: -3.10, -0.68; P-trend = 0.05). Total folate was associated with 2.56 more digits on the DSST (95% CI: 0.82, 4.31; P-trend = 0.01). We also found that higher intakes of vitamin B-6 (quartile 5 compared with quartile 1: 2.62; 95% CI: 0.97, 4.28; P-trend = 0.02) and vitamin B-12 (quartile 5 compared with quartile 1: 2.08; 95% CI: 0.52, 3.65; P-trend = 0.02) resulted in better psychomotor speed measured by DSST scores.Conclusion: Higher intake of B vitamins throughout young adulthood was associated with better cognitive function in midlife.", "28424186": "Circulating concentrations of biomarkers and metabolites related to vitamin status, one-carbon and the kynurenine pathways in US, Nordic, Asian, and Australian populations.\nBackground: Circulating concentrations of biomarkers that are related to vitamin status vary by factors such as diet, fortification, and supplement use. Published biomarker concentrations have also been influenced by the variation across laboratories, which complicates a comparison of results from different studies.Objective: We robustly and comprehensively assessed differences in biomarkers that are related to vitamin status across geographic regions.Design: The trial was a cross-sectional study in which we investigated 38 biomarkers that are related to vitamin status and one-carbon and tryptophan metabolism in serum and plasma from 5314 healthy control subjects representing 20 cohorts recruited from the United States, Nordic countries, Asia, and Australia, participating in the Lung Cancer Cohort Consortium. All samples were analyzed in a centralized laboratory.Results: Circulating concentrations of riboflavin, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, folate, vitamin B-12, all-trans retinol, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and \u03b1-tocopherol as well as combined vitamin scores that were based on these nutrients showed that the general B-vitamin concentration was highest in the United States and that the B vitamins and lipid soluble vitamins were low in Asians. Conversely, circulating concentrations of metabolites that are inversely related to B vitamins involved in the one-carbon and kynurenine pathways were high in Asians. The high B-vitamin concentration in the United States appears to be driven mainly by multivitamin-supplement users.Conclusions: The observed differences likely reflect the variation in intake of vitamins and, in particular, the widespread multivitamin-supplement use in the United States. The results provide valuable information about the differences in biomarker concentrations in populations across continents.", "28507011": "Influence of Diet in Multiple Sclerosis: A Systematic Review.\nNutrition is considered to be a possible factor in the pathogenesis of the neurological disease multiple sclerosis (MS). Nutrition intervention studies suggest that diet may be considered as a complementary treatment to control the progression of the disease; a systematic review of the literature on the influence of diet on MS was therefore conducted. The literature search was conducted by using Medlars Online International Literature (MEDLINE) via PubMed and Scopus. Forty-seven articles met the inclusion criteria. The reviewed articles assessed the relations between macro- and micronutrient intakes and MS incidence. The patients involved used alternative therapies (homeopathy), protocolized diets that included particular foods (herbal products such as grape seed extract, ginseng, blueberries, green tea, etc.), or dietary supplements such as vitamin D, carnitine, melatonin, or coenzyme Q10. Current studies suggest that high serum concentrations of vitamin D, a potent immunomodulator, may decrease the risk of MS and the risk of relapse and new lesions, while improving brain lesions and timed tandem walking. Experimental evidence suggests that serum vitamin D concentration is lower during MS relapses than in remission and is associated with a greater degree of disability [Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score >3]. The findings suggest that circulating vitamin D concentrations can be considered a biomarker of MS and supplemental vitamin D can be used therapeutically. Other studies point to a negative correlation between serum vitamin B-12 concentrations and EDSS score. Vitamin B-12 has fundamental roles in central nervous system function, especially in the methionine synthase-mediated conversion of homocysteine to methionine, which is essential for DNA and RNA synthesis. Therefore, vitamin B-12 deficiency may lead to an increase in the concentration of homocysteine. Further research is clearly necessary to determine whether treatment with vitamin B-12 supplements delays MS progression.", "28814396": "Consumption of galacto-oligosaccharides increases iron absorption from a micronutrient powder containing ferrous fumarate and sodium iron EDTA: a stable-isotope study in Kenyan infants.\nBackground: Whether consumption of prebiotics increases iron absorption in infants is unclear.Objective: We set out to determine whether prebiotic consumption affects iron absorption from a micronutrient powder (MNP) containing a mixture of ferrous fumarate and sodium iron EDTA (FeFum+NaFeEDTA) in Kenyan infants.Design: Infants (n = 50; aged 6-14 mo) consumed maize porridge that was fortified with an MNP containing FeFum+NaFeEDTA and 7.5 g galacto-oligosaccharides (GOSs) (Fe+GOS group, n = 22) or the same MNP without GOSs (Fe group, n = 28) each day for 3 wk. Then, on 2 consecutive days, we fed all infants isotopically labeled maize porridge and MNP test meals containing 5 mg Fe as 57FeFum+Na58FeEDTA or ferrous sulfate (54FeSO4). Iron absorption was measured as the erythrocyte incorporation of stable isotopes. Iron markers, fecal pH, and bacterial groups were assessed at baseline and 3 wk. Comparisons within and between groups were done with the use of mixed-effects models.Results: There was a significant group-by-compound interaction on iron absorption (P = 0.011). The median percentages of fractional iron absorption from FeFum+NaFeEDTA and from FeSO4 in the Fe group were 11.6% (IQR: 6.9-19.9%) and 20.3% (IQR: 14.2-25.7%), respectively, (P < 0.001) and, in the Fe+GOS group, were 18.8% (IQR: 8.3-37.5%) and 25.5% (IQR: 15.1-37.8%), respectively (P = 0.124). Between groups, iron absorption was greater from the FeFum+NaFeEDTA (P = 0.047) in the Fe+GOS group but not from the FeSO4 (P = 0.653). The relative iron bioavailability from FeFum+NaFeEDTA compared with FeSO4 was higher in the Fe+GOS group than in the Fe group (88% compared with 63%; P = 0.006). There was a significant time-by-group interaction on Bifidobacterium spp. (P = 0.008) and Lactobacillus/Pediococcus/Leuconostoc spp. (P = 0.018); Lactobacillus/Pediococcus/Leuconostoc spp. decreased in the Fe group (P = 0.013), and there was a nonsignificant trend toward higher Bifidobacterium spp. in the Fe+GOS group (P = 0.099). At 3 wk, iron absorption was negatively correlated with fecal pH (P < 0.001) and positively correlated with Lactobacillus/Pediococcus/Leuconostoc spp. (P = 0.001).Conclusion: GOS consumption by infants increased iron absorption by 62% from an MNP containing FeFum+NaFeEDTA, thereby possibly reflecting greater colonic iron absorption.

OBJECTIVE: We explored concentrations of fasting unmetabolized folic acid (UFA) in the circulation of children living in Ireland who were exposed to the voluntary folic acid-fortification regimen in place in Ireland. DESIGN: Healthy children who were attending Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin, for routine minor surgery were recruited to provide a fasting 3-mL blood sample that was taken while a general anesthetic was administered. The samples were analyzed for plasma folate, red blood cell folate, and UFA concentrations. A short dietary questionnaire that captured recent and habitual intakes of folic acid, both as supplements and as fortified foods, was completed face to face with parents. RESULTS: We collected fasting samples (n = 68) and completed questionnaires that captured recent and habitual daily folic acid intakes of children grouped as follows: 0-5 y of age: 6 girls and 21 boys (27 children total); 6-10 y of age: 10 girls and 10 boys (20 children total); and 11-16 y of age: 10 girls and 11 boys (21 children total). UFA was detected in 10.3% of the samples tested (range: 0.5-1.3 nmol/L). Mean plasma folate and red blood cell folate concentrations were 35.1 nmol/L (range: 21-47 nmol/L) and 956 nmol/L (range: 305-2319 nmol/L), respectively. Mean daily intake of folic acid from fortified foods and supplements was 109 \u03bcg (range: 0-767 \u03bcg). CONCLUSIONS: We showed that there was UFA in the plasma of just >10% of the children sampled after an overnight fast. These findings should be considered by policy makers who are responsible for folic acid fortification.

Most previous reports have evaluated populations with high calcium intake.Objective: We aimed to evaluate whether high dietary calcium intake was associated with the risk of CVD, stroke, and fracture in a population with low calcium intake.Design: In a prospective cohort study beginning in 2001 in Ansung-Ansan, Korea, 2158 men and 2153 women aged >50 y were evaluated for all-cause mortality, CVD, stroke, and fractures over a median 9-y follow-up.Results: During follow-up, 242 and 100 deaths, 149 and 150 CVD events, 58 and 82 stroke events, and 211 and 292 incident fractures occurred in men and women, respectively. The first quartiles of energy-adjusted dietary calcium intake were 249 mg/d (IQR: 169 mg/d) in men and 209 mg/d (IQR: 161 mg/d) in women. Both men and women with higher dietary calcium intake tended to have higher fat, protein, sodium, phosphorus, fruit, and vegetable intakes. In men, outcomes were not significantly associated with dietary calcium intake with or without adjustments, and CVD risk tended to increase with increasing energy-adjusted dietary calcium intake, but this was not statistically significant (P = 0.078 and P = 0.093 with and without adjustment, respectively). In women, CVD risk and dietary calcium intake showed a U-shaped association; the HRs (95% CIs) without adjustment relative to the first quartile were 0.71 (0.47, 1.07), 0.57 (0.36, 0.88), and 0.52 (0.33, 0.83) for quartiles 2, 3, and 4, respectively, and the values after adjustment were 0.70 (0.45, 1.07), 0.51 (0.31, 0.81), and 0.49 (0.29, 0.83) for quartiles 2, 3, and 4, respectively.Conclusion: In Korean women, increased dietary calcium intake was associated with a decreased CVD risk, but it did not influence the risk of stroke or fracture.", "28659298": "Nutritional metabolomics and breast cancer risk in a prospective study.\nBackground: The epidemiologic evidence for associations between dietary factors and breast cancer is weak and etiologic mechanisms are often unclear. Exploring the role of dietary biomarkers with metabolomics can potentially facilitate objective dietary characterization, mitigate errors related to self-reported diet, agnostically test metabolic pathways, and identify mechanistic mediators.Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate associations of diet-related metabolites with the risk of breast cancer in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial.Design: We examined prediagnostic serum concentrations of diet-related metabolites in a nested case-control study in 621 postmenopausal invasive breast cancer cases and 621 matched controls in the multicenter PLCO cohort. We calculated partial Pearson correlations between 617 metabolites and 55 foods, food groups, and vitamin supplements on the basis of the 2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans and derived from a 137-item self-administered food-frequency questionnaire. Diet-related metabolites (P-correlation < 1.47 \u00d7 10-6) were evaluated in breast cancer analyses. ORs for the 90th compared with the 10th percentile were calculated by using conditional logistic regression, with body mass index, physical inactivity, other breast cancer risk factors, and caloric intake controlled for (false discovery rate <0.2).Results: Of 113 diet-related metabolites, 3 were associated with overall breast cancer risk (621 cases): caprate (10:0), a saturated fatty acid (OR: 1.77; 95% CI = 1.28, 2.43); \u03b3-carboxyethyl hydrochroman (\u03b3-CEHC), a vitamin E (\u03b3-tocopherol) derivative (OR: 1.64; 95% CI: 1.18, 2.28); and 4-androsten-3\u03b2,17\u03b2-diol-monosulfate (1), an androgen (OR: 1.61; 95% CI: 1.20, 2.16). Nineteen metabolites were significantly associated with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive (ER+) breast cancer (418 cases): 12 alcohol-associated metabolites, including 7 androgens and \u03b1-hydroxyisovalerate (OR: 2.23; 95% CI: 1.50, 3.32); 3 vitamin E (tocopherol) derivatives (e.g., \u03b3-CEHC; OR: 1.80; 95% CI: 1.20, 2.70); butter-associated caprate (10:0) (OR: 1.81; 95% CI: 1.23, 2.67); and fried food-associated 2-hydroxyoctanoate (OR: 1.46; 95% CI: 1.03, 2.07). No metabolites were significantly associated with ER-negative breast cancer (144 cases).Conclusions: Prediagnostic serum concentrations of metabolites related to alcohol, vitamin E, and animal fats were moderately strongly associated with ER+ breast cancer risk.

In the general population, evidence has suggested that high circulating folate and folic acid (synthetic form of folate) supplement use may increase breast cancer risk, but the role of folate in BRCA-associated breast cancer is not clear. OBJECTIVE: We prospectively evaluated the relation between plasma folate, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP; the biologically active form of vitamin B-6), and vitamin B-12 and breast cancer risk in women with a BRCA1/2 mutation. DESIGN: Baseline blood samples and biennial follow-up questionnaires were available for 164 BRCA1/2-mutation carriers with no previous history of cancer other than nonmelanoma skin cancer. Plasma folate, PLP, and vitamin B-12 concentrations were categorized dichotomously as high compared with low based on the upper 25% and the lower 75% of distribution, respectively. Cox proportional hazards were used to estimate the HR and 95% CI for the association between plasma biomarkers of each B vitamin and incident breast cancer. RESULTS: Over a mean follow-up of 6.3 y, 20 incident primary invasive breast cancers were observed. Women with high plasma folate concentrations (>24.4 ng/mL) were associated with significantly increased breast cancer risk (HR: 3.20; 95% CI: 1.03, 9.92; P = 0.04, P-trend across quintiles = 0.07) compared with that of women with low plasma folate concentrations (\u226424.4 ng/mL). Plasma PLP and vitamin B-12 concentrations were not associated with breast cancer risk. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that elevated plasma folate concentrations may be associated with increased risk of breast cancer in women with a BRCA1/2 mutation.

Fruits are relatively low in energy density and are an excellent source of antioxidants and prebiotic fibers and polyphenols, which can promote digestive health. Yogurt, on the other hand, is a nutrient-dense food that is a good source of dairy protein, calcium, magnesium, vitamin B-12, conjugated linoleic acid, and other key fatty acids. In addition, it contains beneficial bacterial cultures, making it a potential source of probiotics. Yogurt's unique fermented food matrix provides added health benefits by enhancing nutrient absorption and digestion. Combining the intake of yogurt and fruit could provide probiotics, prebiotics, high-quality protein, important fatty acids, and a mixture of vitamins and minerals that have the potential to exert synergistic effects on health. Yogurt consumption has been associated with reduced weight gain and a lower incidence of type 2 diabetes, whereas fruits have established effects on reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease. Yogurt and fruits can be eaten together and may exert combined health benefits through potential prebiotic and probiotic effects. Furthermore, substituting high-energy, nutrient-deficient snacks with fruit and yogurt could reduce the intake of high-calorie obesogenic foods. In light of the positive cardiometabolic impacts of fruit and yogurt and their association with healthy dietary patterns, there is sufficient evidence to warrant further exploration into the potential synergistic health benefits of a combined intake of fruit and yogurt.", "27272334": "Safe use of high intakes of folic acid: research challenges and paths forward.\nAdequate folic acid intake is an effective dietary-based prevention tool for reducing the risk of neural tube defects. Achieving adequate intake for the prevention of neural tube defects frequently requires the consumption of foods fortified with folic acid and/or the use of folic acid-containing dietary supplements. To date, research on the potential for adverse effects of high intakes of folic acid has been limited. Without such research, it is difficult to define a value for high intake. In May 2015, an expert panel was tasked with examining the available scientific literature and making research recommendations within 4 general categories of potential folate-related adverse health effects: cancer, cognition in conjunction with vitamin B12 deficiency, hypersensitivity-related outcomes, and thyroid and diabetes-related disorders. This article summarizes the expert panel's conclusions, outlines the challenges faced when reviewing the literature, and examines some of the panel's recommendations for research.", "27465372": "Soluble corn fiber increases bone calcium retention in postmenopausal women in a dose-dependent manner: a randomized crossover trial.\nBACKGROUND: Dietary soluble corn fiber (SCF) significantly improves calcium absorption in adolescents and the bone strength and architecture in rodent models. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to determine the skeletal benefits of SCF in postmenopausal women. DESIGN: We used our novel technology of determining bone calcium retention by following the urinary appearance of (41)Ca, a rare long-lived radioisotope, from prelabeled bone to rapidly and sensitively evaluate the effectiveness of SCF in reducing bone loss. A randomized-order, crossover, double-blinded trial was performed in 14 healthy postmenopausal women to compare doses of 0, 10, and 20 g fiber from SCF/d for 50 d. RESULTS: A dose-response effect was shown with 10 and 20 g fiber from SCF/d, whereby bone calcium retention was improved by 4.8% (P < 0.05) and 7% (P < 0.04), respectively. The bone turnover biomarkers N-terminal telopeptide and osteocalcin were not changed by the interventions; however, a significant increase in bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, which is a bone-formation marker, was detected between 0 and 20 g fiber from SCF/d (8%; P = 0.035). CONCLUSION: Daily SCF consumption significantly increased bone calcium retention in postmenopausal women, which improved the bone calcium balance by an estimated 50 mg/d.

Objective: The effect of krill oil supplements on plasma lipid concentrations was assessed through a systematic review of the literature and a meta-analysis of available randomized controlled trials. Data sources: PubMed and Scopus were searched up to March 25, 2016, to identify RCTs investigating the effect of krill oil supplements on plasma lipids. Study selection: Randomized controlled trials that investigated the impact of at least 2 weeks of supplementation with krill oil on plasma/serum concentrations of at least one of the main lipid parameters (ie, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or triglycerides) and that reported sufficient information on plasma/serum lipid levels at baseline and at the end of study in both krill oil and control groups were eligible for inclusion. Data extraction: Two reviewers independently extracted the following data: first author's name, year of publication, study location, study design, number of participants in the krill oil and control groups, dosage of krill oil, type of control allocation, treatment duration, demographic characteristics of study participants, and baseline and follow-up plasma concentrations of lipids. Effect size was expressed as the weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI). Results: Meta-analysis of data from 7 eligible trials (14 treatment arms) with 662 participants showed a significant reduction in plasma concentrations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (WMD, -15.52\u2009mg/dL; 95%CI, -28.43 to -2.61; P\u2009=\u20090.018) and triglycerides (WMD, -14.03\u2009mg/dL; 95%CI, -21.38 to -6.67; P\u2009<\u20090.001) following supplementation with krill oil. A significant elevation in plasma concentrations of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was also observed (WMD, 6.65\u2009mg/dL; 95%CI, 2.30 to 10.99; P\u2009=\u20090.003), while a reduction in plasma concentrations of total cholesterol did not reach statistical significance (WMD, -7.50\u2009mg/dL; 95%CI, -17.94 to 2.93; P\u2009=\u20090.159). Conclusion: Krill oil supplementation can reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides. Additional clinical studies with more participants are needed to assess the impact of krill oil supplementation on other indices of cardiometabolic risk and on the risk of cardiovascular outcomes.", "27146015": "Citrus Flavonoids as Regulators of Lipoprotein Metabolism and Atherosclerosis.\nCitrus flavonoids are polyphenolic compounds with significant biological properties. This review summarizes recent advances in understanding the ability of citrus flavonoids to modulate lipid metabolism, other metabolic parameters related to the metabolic syndrome, and atherosclerosis. Citrus flavonoids, including naringenin, hesperitin, nobiletin, and tangeretin, have emerged as potential therapeutics for the treatment of metabolic dysregulation. Epidemiological studies reveal an association between the intake of citrus flavonoid-containing foods and a decreased incidence of cardiovascular disease. Studies in cell culture and animal models, as well as a limited number of clinical studies, reveal the lipid-lowering, insulin-sensitizing, antihypertensive, and anti-inflammatory properties of citrus flavonoids. In animal models, supplementation of rodent diets with citrus flavonoids prevents hepatic steatosis, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance primarily through inhibition of hepatic fatty acid synthesis and increased fatty acid oxidation. Citrus flavonoids blunt the inflammatory response in metabolically important tissues including liver, adipose, kidney, and the aorta. The mechanisms underlying flavonoid-induced metabolic regulation have not been completely established, although several potential targets have been identified. In mouse models, citrus flavonoids show marked suppression of atherogenesis through improved metabolic parameters as well as through direct impact on the vessel wall. Recent studies support a role for citrus flavonoids in the treatment of dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis, obesity, and atherosclerosis. Larger human studies examining dose, bioavailability, efficacy, and safety are required to promote the development of these promising therapeutic agents.", "27733403": "Estimation of the dietary requirement for vitamin D in white children aged 4-8 y: a randomized, controlled, dose-response trial.\nBACKGROUND: Children in northern latitudes are at high risk of vitamin D deficiency during winter because of negligible dermal vitamin D3 production. However, to our knowledge, the dietary requirement for maintaining the nutritional adequacy of vitamin D in young children has not been investigated. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to establish the distribution of vitamin D intakes required to maintain winter serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations above the proposed cutoffs (25, 30, 40, and 50 nmol/L) in white Danish children aged 4-8 y living at 55\u00b0N. DESIGN: In a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial 119 children (mean age: 6.7 y) were assigned to 0 (placebo), 10, or 20 \u03bcg vitamin D3/d supplementation for 20 wk. We measured anthropometry, dietary vitamin D, and serum 25(OH)D with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry at baseline and endpoint. RESULTS: The mean \u00b1 SD baseline serum 25(OH)D was 56.7 \u00b1 12.3 nmol/L (range: 28.7-101.4 nmol/L). Serum 25(OH)D increased by a mean \u00b1 SE of 4.9 \u00b1 1.3 and 17.7 \u00b1 1.8 nmol/L in the groups receiving 10 and 20 \u03bcg vitamin D3/d, respectively, and decreased by 24.1 \u00b1 1.2 nmol/L in the placebo group (P < 0.001). A nonlinear model of serum 25(OH)D as a function of total vitamin D intake (diet and supplements) was fit to the data. The estimated vitamin D intakes required to maintain winter serum 25(OH)D >30 (avoiding deficiency) and >50 nmol/L (ensuring adequacy) in 97.5% of participants were 8.3 and 19.5 \u03bcg/d, respectively, and 4.4 \u03bcg/d was required to maintain serum 25(OH)D >40 nmol/L in 50% of participants. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D intakes between 8 and 20 \u03bcg/d are required by white 4- to 8-y-olds during winter in northern latitudes to maintain serum 25(OH)D >30-50 nmol/L depending on chosen serum 25(OH)D threshold.

It is recommended that women who could become pregnant, are pregnant, or are lactating consume a folic acid (FA)-containing supplement.Objectives: We sought to determine breast-milk total folate and unmetabolized folic acid (UMFA) contents and their relation with FA-supplement use and doses in a cohort of Canadian mothers who were enrolled in the MIREC (Maternal-Infant Research on Environmental Chemicals) study.Design: Breast-milk tetrahydrofolate (THF), 5-methyl-THF, 5-formyl-THF, 5,10-methenyl-THF, and UMFA were measured with the use of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (n = 561). Total daily supplemental FA intake was based on self-reported FA-supplement use.Results: UMFA was detectable in the milk of 96.1% of the women. Total daily FA intake from supplements was associated with breast folate concentration and species. Breast-milk total folate was 18% higher (P < 0.001) in supplement users (n = 401) than in nonusers (n = 160), a difference driven by women consuming >400 \u03bcg FA/d (P \u2264 0.004). 5-Methyl-THF was 19% lower (P < 0.001) and UMFA was 126% higher (P < 0.001) in supplement users than in nonusers. Women who consumed >400 \u03bcg FA/d had proportionally lower 5-methyl-THF and higher UMFA than did women who consumed \u2264400 \u03bcg FA/d.Conclusions: FA-supplement use was associated with modestly higher breast-milk total folate. Detectable breast-milk UMFA was nearly ubiquitous, including in women who did not consume an FA supplement. Breast-milk UMFA was proportionally higher than 5-methyl-THF in women who consumed >400 \u03bcg FA/d, thereby suggesting that higher doses exceed the physiologic capacity to metabolize FA and result in the preferential uptake of FA in breast milk. Therefore, FA-supplement doses >400 \u03bcg may not be warranted, especially in populations for whom FA fortification is mandatory.", "28130504": "Early-life nutritional exposures and lifelong health: immediate and long-lasting impacts of probiotics, vitamin D, and breastfeeding.\nPregnancy and infancy comprise the most critical stages for conditioning an individual's health, with a number of implications for subsequent risks of morbidity, mortality, and reproductive health. Nutrition may influence both the overall pregnancy outcome and the growth trajectory and immune system of the fetus and infant, with short- and long-term effects on the health of the offspring. Within this context, leading experts at Expo Milano 2015 in Milan, Italy, discussed up-to-date knowledge while providing suggestions and challenges before, during, and after pregnancy. This narrative review summarizes the key issues raised by the experts concerning the interplay between the nutritional environment from conception to early infancy and the offspring's immediate and lifelong health, with a particular focus on epigenetic mechanisms, probiotics, vitamin D, and breastfeeding. Taken together, the findings strengthen the awareness that nutritional exposures occurring from preconception to the postnatal period may be strong determinants of the offspring's health and may provide supportive evidence for current nutritional recommendations and guidelines for pregnant women and infants. Critical topics to be addressed in future research and translated into recommendations of public health relevance are also highlighted.", "27680989": "Do \u03c9-3 PUFAs affect insulin resistance in a sex-specific manner? A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.\nBACKGROUND: Evidence has suggested that omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) improve obesity-induced insulin resistance (IR); however, results from human intervention trials have been equivocal. Recently it has been reported that n-3 PUFA status is inversely associated with type 2 diabetes in women but not in men, suggesting a sex-dependent effect. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine whether n-3 PUFA interventions affect IR in a sex-dependent manner. DESIGN: Five databases were searched (Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, Scopus, and Pre-Medline) for randomized controlled trials. Searches were limited to the English language and to studies with adults aged >18 y. When possible, studies were pooled for a meta-analysis. The principle summary measure was the standardized mean difference (SMD) between groups. RESULTS: Thirty-one eligible trials were identified with a total of 1848 participants [men: 45.1%; weighted mean \u00b1 SD age: 52.5 \u00b1 8.2 y; weighted body mass index (in kg/m2): 28.8 \u00b1 3.0]. Seven studies were conducted in women, 4 studies were conducted in men, and the remaining studies pooled men and women together. Twenty-six trials were pooled for the meta-analysis (men: n = 2; women: n = 6). With all studies (n = 26) pooled, there was no effect of n-3 PUFA on IR at the group level (SMD: 0.089; 95% CI: -0.105, 0.283; P = 0.367). In trials of \u22656 wk, a significant improvement in IR was seen in women (SMD: -0.266; 95% CI: -0.524, -0.007; P = 0.045) but not in men (SMD: 0.619; 95% CI: -0.583, 1.820; P = 0.313). CONCLUSIONS: With this analysis, we provide preliminary evidence of a sex-dependent response of IR to an n-3 PUFA intervention. Additional studies are needed to confirm sex-dependent associations and to elucidate the potential mechanisms that are involved.

Each participant consumed a single oral dose of 35 mg 13C-EPA and its metabolism was followed in the course of 14 d in the plasma and 28 d in the breath. After the washout period of \u226528 d, the same participants consumed a single oral dose of 50 mg 13C-AA and its metabolism was followed for 28 d in plasma and breath.Results: There was a time \u00d7 age interaction for 13C-EPA (Ptime \u00d7 age = 0.008), and the shape of the postprandial curves was different between young and old men. The 13C-EPA plasma half-life was \u223c2 d for both young and old men (P = 0.485). The percentage dose recovered of 13C-EPA per hour as 13CO2 and the cumulative \u03b2-oxidation of 13C-EPA did not differ between young and old men. At 7 d, however, old men had a >2.2-fold higher plasma 13C-DHA concentration synthesized from 13C-EPA compared with young men (Page = 0.03). 13C-AA metabolism was not different between young and old men. The 13C-AA plasma half-life was \u223c4.4 d in both young and old participants (P = 0.589).Conclusions: The metabolism of 13C-AA was not modified by age, whereas 13C-EPA metabolism was slightly but significantly different in old compared with young men. The higher plasma 13C-DHA seen in old men may be a result of slower plasma DHA clearance with age.

However, hormone replacement therapy is demonstrated to increase cancer risk. Bioavailable isoflavones with selective estrogen receptor affinity show potential to prevent and treat osteoporosis while minimizing or eliminating carcinogenic side effects.Objective: In this study, we sought to determine the beneficial effects of a bioavailable isoflavone and probiotic treatment against postmenopausal osteopenia.Design: We used a novel red clover extract (RCE) rich in isoflavone aglycones and probiotics to concomitantly promote uptake and a favorable intestinal bacterial profile to enhance isoflavone bioavailability. This was a 12-mo, double-blind, parallel design, placebo-controlled, randomized controlled trial of 78 postmenopausal osteopenic women supplemented with calcium (1200 mg/d), magnesium (550 mg/d), and calcitriol (25 \u03bcg/d) given either RCE (60 mg isoflavone aglycones/d and probiotics) or a masked placebo [control (CON)].Results: RCE significantly attenuated bone mineral density (BMD) loss at the L2-L4 lumbar spine vertebra (P < 0.05), femoral neck (P < 0.01), and trochanter (P < 0.01) compared with CON (-0.99% and -2.2%; -1.04% and -3.05%; and -0.67% and -2.79, respectively). Plasma concentrations of collagen type 1 cross-linked C-telopeptide was significantly decreased in the RCE group (P < 0.05) compared with CON (-9.40% and -6.76%, respectively). RCE significantly elevated the plasma isoflavone concentration (P < 0.05), the urinary 2-hydroxyestrone (2-OH) to 16\u03b1-hydroxyestrone (16\u03b1-OH) ratio (P < 0.05), and equol-producer status (P < 0.05) compared with CON. RCE had no significant effect on other bone turnover biomarkers. Self-reported diet and physical activity were consistent and differences were nonsignificant between groups throughout the study. RCE was well tolerated with no adverse events.Conclusions: Twice daily RCE intake over 1 y potently attenuated BMD loss caused by estrogen deficiency, improved bone turnover, promoted a favorable estrogen metabolite profile (2-OH:16\u03b1-OH), and stimulated equol production in postmenopausal women with osteopenia. RCE intake combined with supplementation (calcium, magnesium, and calcitriol) was more effective than supplementation alone.

Recent publications have questioned the utility of self-reported dietary intake data in research and monitoring.Objectives: The purpose of this analysis was to examine the relation between self-reported folate intakes and folate status biomarkers and to evaluate their usefulness for several types of applications.Design: We examined usual dietary intakes of folate by using the National Cancer Institute method to adjust two 24-h dietary recalls (including dietary supplements) for within-person variation and then compared these intakes with serum and red blood cell (RBC) folate among 4878 men and nonpregnant, nonlactating women aged \u226519 y in NHANES 2011-2012, a nationally representative, cross-sectional survey, with respect to consistency across prevalence estimates and rank order comparisons.Results: There was a very low prevalence (<1%) of folate deficiency when serum (<7 nmol/L) and RBC (<305 nmol/L) folate were considered, whereas a higher proportion of the population reported inadequate total dietary folate intakes (6%). Similar patterns of change occurred between intakes and biomarkers of folate status when distributions were examined (i.e., dose response), particularly when diet was expressed in \u03bcg. Intakes greater than the Tolerable Upper Intake Level greatly increased the odds of having high serum folate (OR: 17.6; 95% CI: 5.5, 56.0).Conclusions: When assessing folate status in the United States, where fortification and supplement use are common, similar patterns in the distributions of diet and biomarkers suggest that these 2 types of status indicators reflect the same underlying folate status; however, the higher prevalence estimates for inadequate intakes compared with biomarkers suggest, among other factors, a systematic underestimation bias in intake data. Caution is needed in the use of dietary folate data to estimate the prevalence of inadequacy among population groups. The use of dietary data for rank order comparisons or to estimate the potential for dietary excess is likely more reliable.", "28362165": "Physiological protection of probiotic microcapsules by coatings.\nNowadays, food and nutrition have a greater impact in people's concerns, with the awareness that nutrition have a direct impact in health and wellbeing. Probiotics have an important role in this topic and consumers are starting to really understand their potential in health, leading to an increasing interest of the companies to their commercial use in foods. However, there are several limitations to the use of probiotics in foods and beverages, being one of them their efficiency (directly associated to their survival rate) upon ingestion. This work is focused in microencapsulation techniques that have been used to increase probiotics efficiency. More specifically, this work reviews the most recent and relevant research about the production and coating techniques of probiotic-loaded microcapsules, providing an insight in the effect of these coatings in probiotics survival during the gastrointestinal phase. This review shows that coatings with the better performances in probiotics protection, against the harsh conditions of digestion, are chitosan, alginate, poly-L-lysine, and whey protein. Chitosan presented an interesting performance in probiotics protection being able to maintain the initial concentration of viable probiotics during a digestive test. The analyses of different works also showed that the utilization of several coatings does not guarantee a better protection in comparison with monocoated microcapsules.", "28424185": "Very-long-chain \nBackground: Increased omega-3 (n-3) fatty acid consumption is reported to benefit patients with metabolic syndrome, possibly due to improved adipose tissue function.Objective: We tested the effects of high-dose, very-long-chain \u03c9-3 fatty acids on adipose tissue inflammation and insulin regulation of lipolysis.Design: A double-blind, placebo-controlled study compared 6 mo of 3.9 g eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)/d (4.2 g total \u03c9-3/d; n = 12) with a placebo (4.2 g oleate/d; n = 9) in insulin-resistant adults. Before and after treatment, the volunteers underwent adipose tissue biopsies to measure the total (CD68+), pro- (CD14+ = M1), and anti- (CD206+ = M2) inflammatory macrophages, crown-like structures, and senescent cells, as well as a 2-step pancreatic clamping with a [U-13C]palmitate infusion to determine the insulin concentration needed to suppress palmitate flux by 50% (IC50(palmitate)f).Results: In the \u03c9-3 group, the EPA and DHA contributions to plasma free fatty acids increased (P = 0.0003 and P = 0.003, respectively), as did the EPA and DHA content in adipose tissue (P < 0.0001 and P < 0.0001, respectively). Despite increases in adipose and plasma EPA and DHA in the \u03c9-3 group, there were no significant changes in the IC50(palmitate)f (19 \u00b1 2 compared with 24 \u00b1 3 \u03bcIU/mL), adipose macrophages (total: 31 \u00b1 2/100 adipocytes compared with 33 \u00b1 2/100 adipocytes; CD14+: 13 \u00b1 2/100 adipocytes compared with 14 \u00b1 2/100 adipocytes; CD206+: 28 \u00b1 2/100 adipocytes compared with 29 \u00b1 3/100 adipocytes), crown-like structures (1 \u00b1 0/10 images compared with 1 \u00b1 0/10 images), or senescent cells (4% \u00b1 1% compared with 4% \u00b1 1%).

Adult humans possess a substantial amount of BAT in the form of constitutively active brown fat or inducible beige fat. BAT activity in humans is inversely correlated with adiposity, blood glucose concentrations, and insulin sensitivity; this suggests that strategies aimed at BAT-mediated bioenergetics are an attractive therapeutic target in combating the continuing epidemic of obesity and diabetes. Despite advances in knowledge regarding the developmental lineage and transcriptional regulators of brown and beige adipocytes, our current understanding of environmental modifiers of BAT thermogenesis, such as diet, is limited. In this review, we consolidated the latest research on dietary molecules that may serve to promote BAT thermogenesis. Here, we summarized the thermogenic function of selected phytochemicals (e.g., capsaicin, resveratrol, curcumin, green tea, and berberine), dietary fatty acids (e.g., fish oil and conjugated linoleic acids), and all-trans retinoic acid, a vitamin A metabolite. We also delineated the proposed mechanisms whereby these dietary molecules promote BAT activity and/or browning of white adipose tissue. Characterizing thermogenic dietary factors may offer novel insight into revising nutritional intervention strategies aimed at obesity and diabetes prevention and management.", "26762372": "The effects of lutein on cardiometabolic health across the life course: a systematic review and meta-analysis.\nBACKGROUND: The antioxidant lutein is suggested as being beneficial to cardiometabolic health because of its protective effect against oxidative stress, but evidence has not systematically been evaluated. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate systematically the effects of lutein (intake or concentrations) on cardiometabolic outcomes in different life stages. DESIGN: This is a systematic review with meta-analysis of literature published in MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central, Web of Science, PubMed, and Google Scholar up to August 2014. Included were trials and cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies in which the association between lutein concentrations, dietary intake, or supplements and cardiometabolic outcomes was reported. Two independent investigators reviewed the articles. RESULTS: Seventy-one relevant articles were identified that included a total of 387,569 participants. Only 1 article investigated the effects of lutein during pregnancy, and 3 studied lutein in children. Furthermore, 31 longitudinal, 33 cross-sectional, and 3 intervention studies were conducted in adults. Meta-analysis showed a lower risk of coronary heart disease (pooled RR: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.80, 0.98) and stroke (pooled RR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.72, 0.93) for the highest compared with the lowest tertile of lutein blood concentration or intake. There was no significant association with type 2 diabetes mellitus (pooled RR: 0.97; 95% CI: 0.77, 1.22), but higher lutein was associated with a lower risk of metabolic syndrome (pooled RR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.60, 0.92) for the highest compared with the lowest tertile. The literature on risk factors for cardiometabolic diseases showed that lutein might be beneficial for atherosclerosis and inflammatory markers, but there were inconsistent associations with blood pressure, adiposity, insulin resistance, and blood lipids. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that higher dietary intake and higher blood concentrations of lutein are generally associated with better cardiometabolic health. However, evidence mainly comes from observational studies in adults, whereas large-scale intervention studies and studies of lutein during pregnancy and childhood are scarce.", "27935521": "Leucine supplementation enhances integrative myofibrillar protein synthesis in free-living older men consuming lower- and higher-protein diets: a parallel-group crossover study.\nBACKGROUND: Leucine co-ingestion with lower-protein (LP)-containing meals may overcome the blunted muscle protein synthetic response to food intake in the elderly but may be effective only in individuals who consume LP diets. OBJECTIVE: We examined the impact of leucine co-ingestion with mixed macronutrient meals on integrated 3-d rates of myofibrillar protein synthesis (MyoPS) in free-living older men who consumed higher protein (HP) (1.2 g \u00b7 kg-1 \u00b7 d-1) or LP (0.8 g \u00b7 kg-1 \u00b7 d-1) in rested and resistance exercise (REX) conditions. DESIGN: In a crossover design, 20 healthy older men [aged 65-85 y] were randomly assigned to receive LP or HP diets while ingesting a placebo (days 0-2) and Leu supplement (5 g leucine/meal; days 3-5) with their 3 main daily meals. A bout of unilateral REX was performed during the placebo and Leu treatments. Ingested 2H2O and skeletal muscle biopsies were used to measure the 3-d integrated rate of MyoPS during the placebo and Leu treatments in the rested and REX legs. RESULTS: Leucinemia was higher with Leu treatment than with placebo treatment (P < 0.001). MyoPS was similar in LP and HP during both treatments (P = 0.39) but was higher with Leu treatment than with placebo treatment in the rested (pooled mean \u00b1 SD: Leu, 1.57% \u00b1 0.11%/d; placebo, 1.48% \u00b1 0.08%/d; main effect of treatment: P < 0.001) and REX (pooled mean: Leu, 1.87% \u00b1 0.09%/d; placebo, 1.71 \u00b1 0.10%/d; main effect of treatment: P < 0.001) legs. CONCLUSIONS: Leu co-ingestion with daily meals enhances integrated MyoPS in free-living older men in rested and REX conditions and is equally effective in older men who consume daily protein intakes greater than or equal to the RDA.

Some of the most considered bioactivities of whey peptides including antihypertension, antioxidant, anti-obesity, anti-diabetes, and hypocholesterolemic properties with corresponding underlying mechanisms are briefly discussed. Then, we overview the supramolecular and gelation-prompted encapsulation of nutraceuticals with whey proteins, followed by summarizing recent developments in utilization of synthetic peptides for gene and drug delivery. Finally, particulation of bioactive whey peptides are communicated. Whey peptides may exert both biologically beneficial and technologically appreciated activities. Two procedures including desolvation and internal gelation have been so far employed for bioactive peptides particulation. Crosslinking is a prerequisite to confer acid-induced cold-set gelation to bioactive peptides. It also increases peptides Fe3+-reducing power. Surface activity of a population of peptides in whey protein hydrolysate may result in co-adsorption of the peptides together with small molecule surfactants onto oil-water interface, leading to modulated interfacial architecture and particle morphology.", "28838081": "US Pharmacopeial Convention safety evaluation of menaquinone-7, a form of vitamin K.\nVitamin K plays important biological roles in maintaining normal blood coagulation, bone mineralization, soft tissue physiology, and neurological development. Menaquinone-7 is a form of vitamin K2 that occurs naturally in some animal-derived and fermented foods. It is also available as an ingredient of dietary supplements. Menaquinone-7 has greater bioavailability than other forms of vitamin K, which has led to increasing sales and use of menaquinone-7 supplements. This special article reviews the chemistry, nomenclature, dietary sources, intake levels, and pharmacokinetics of menaquinones, along with the nonclinical toxicity data available and the data on clinical outcomes related to safety (adverse events). In conclusion, the data reviewed indicate that menaquinone-7, when ingested as a dietary supplement, is not associated with any serious risk to health or with other public health concerns. On the basis of this conclusion, US Pharmacopeia monographs have been developed to establish quality standards for menaquinone-7 as a dietary ingredient and as a dietary supplement in various dosage forms.", "28615257": "Randomized controlled trial assessing the efficacy of a reusable fish-shaped iron ingot to increase hemoglobin concentration in anemic, rural Cambodian women.\nBackground: Anemia affects 45% of women of childbearing age in Cambodia. Iron supplementation is recommended in populations in which anemia prevalence is high. However, there are issues of cost, distribution, and adherence. A potential alternative is a reusable fish-shaped iron ingot, which, when added to the cooking pot, leaches iron into the fluid in which it is prepared.Objective: We sought to determine whether there was a difference in hemoglobin concentrations in rural Cambodian anemic women (aged 18-49 y) who cooked with the iron ingot or consumed a daily iron supplement compared with a control after 1 y.Design: In Preah Vihear, 340 women with mild or moderate anemia were randomly assigned to 1) an iron-ingot group, 2) an iron-supplement (18 mg/d) group, or 3) a nonplacebo control group. A venous blood sample was taken at baseline and at 6 and 12 mo. Blood was analyzed for hemoglobin, serum ferritin, and serum transferrin receptor. Hemoglobin electrophoresis was used to detect structural hemoglobin variants.Results: Anemia prevalence was 44% with the use of a portable hemoglobinometer during screening. At baseline, prevalence of iron deficiency was 9% on the basis of a low serum ferritin concentration. There was no significant difference in mean hemoglobin concentrations between the iron-ingot group (115 g/L; 95% CI: 113, 118 g/L; P = 0.850) or iron-supplement group (115 g/L; 95% CI: 113, 117 g/L; P = 0.998) compared with the control group (115 g/L; 95% CI: 113, 117 g/L) at 12 mo. Serum ferritin was significantly higher in the iron-supplement group (73 \u03bcg/L; 95% CI: 64, 82 \u03bcg/L; P = 0.002) than in the control group at 6 mo; however, this significance was not maintained at 12 mo (73 \u03bcg/L; 95% CI: 58, 91 \u03bcg/L; P = 0.176).Conclusions: Neither the iron ingot nor iron supplements increased hemoglobin concentrations in this population at 6 or 12 mo. We do not recommend the use of the fish-shaped iron ingot in Cambodia or in countries where the prevalence of iron deficiency is low and genetic hemoglobin disorders are high. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02341586.", "29021285": "Placental vitamin D metabolism and its associations with circulating vitamin D metabolites in pregnant women.\nBackground: Little is known about placental vitamin D metabolism and its impact on maternal circulating vitamin D concentrations in humans.Objective: This study sought to advance the current understanding of placental vitamin D metabolism and its role in modulating maternal circulating vitamin D metabolites during pregnancy.Design: Nested within a feeding study, 24 healthy pregnant women (26-29 wk of gestation) consumed a single amount of vitamin D (511 IU/d from diet and a cholecalciferol supplement) for 10 wk. Concentrations of placental and blood vitamin D metabolites and placental messenger RNA (mRNA) abundance of vitamin D metabolic pathway components were quantified. In addition, cultured human trophoblasts were incubated with 13C-cholecalciferol to examine the intracellular generation and secretion of vitamin D metabolites along with the regulation of target genes.Results: In placental tissue, 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 [25(OH)D3] was strongly correlated (r = 0.83, P < 0.001) with 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 Moreover, these placental metabolites were strongly correlated (r \u2264 0.85, P \u2264 0.04) with their respective metabolites in maternal circulation. Positive associations (P \u2264 0.045) were also observed between placental mRNA abundance of vitamin D metabolic components and circulating vitamin D metabolites [i.e., LDL-related protein 2 (LRP2, also known as megalin) with 25(OH)D3 and the C3 epimer of 25(OH)D3 [3-epi-25(OH)D3]; cubilin (CUBN) with 25(OH)D3; 25-hydroxylase (CYP2R1) with 3-epi-25(OH)D3; 24-hydroxylase (CYP24A1) with 25(OH)D3, 3-epi-25(OH)D3, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3]; and 1\u03b1-hydroxylase [(CYP27B1) with 3-epi-25(OH)D3 and 1,25(OH)2D3]. Notably, in vitro experiments with trophoblasts showed increased production and secretion of 25(OH)D3 and higher CYP24A1 gene transcript abundance in response to cholecalciferol treatment.Conclusions: The numerous associations of many of the placental biomarkers of vitamin D metabolism with circulating vitamin D metabolites among pregnant women [including a CYP27B1-associated increase in 1,25(OH)2D3] and the evidence of trophoblast production and secretion of vitamin D metabolites, especially 25(OH)D3, suggest that the placenta may play an active role in modulating the vitamin D metabolite profile in maternal circulation in human pregnancy.

However, intervention trials of magnesium supplementation on blood pressure and conventional cardiometabolic risk markers are inconsistent. Effects on vascular function markers related to cardiovascular disease risk have rarely been studied. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to evaluate the effects of long-term magnesium supplementation on arterial stiffness. DESIGN: We performed a 24-wk, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled intervention study. Fifty-two overweight and slightly obese individuals (30 men and 22 postmenopausal women, mean \u00b1 SD age: 62 \u00b1 6 y) were randomly allocated to receive either 3 times daily magnesium (3 \u00d7 117 mg or 350 mg/d) or placebo capsules. Twenty-four-hour urine collections and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure assessments were performed at the start and end of the study. Carotid-to-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWVc-f) was assessed at baseline, after 12 wk, and at week 24. RESULTS: Serum magnesium concentrations did not differ after 12 wk but tended to increase after 24-wk magnesium supplementation compared with placebo by 0.02 mmol/L (95% CI: 0.00, 0.04 mmol/L; P = 0.09). Twenty-four-hour urinary magnesium excretion increased by 2.01 mmol (95% CI: 1.22, 2.93 mmol; P < 0.001) at week 24. PWVc-f was not changed after 12 wk (0.0 m/s; 95% CI: -0.6, 0.5 m/s; P = 0.90) but was improved in the magnesium compared with the placebo group by 1.0 m/s (95% CI: 0.4, 1.6 m/s; P = 0.001) after 24 wk. Office and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure levels were not changed. No adverse events were observed. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that a daily magnesium supplement of 350 mg for 24 wk in overweight and obese adults reduces arterial stiffness, as estimated by a decrease in PWVc-f, suggesting a potential mechanism by which an increased dietary magnesium intake beneficially affects cardiovascular health.

Low-birth-weight (LBW) infants are at high risk of stunting. More than 25% of live births in low- and middle-income countries are at full term with low birth weight (FT-LBW). Evidence on the efficacy of specific interventions to enhance growth in this vulnerable group remains scant. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the independent and combined effects of a directed use of a water-based hand sanitizer (HS) and a mineral- and vitamin-enhanced micronutrient powder (MNP) (22 minerals and vitamins) to prevent infections and improve nutrient intake to reduce stunting in FT-LBW infants. DESIGN: The study was a prospective 2 \u00d7 2 factorial, cluster-randomized trial in 467 FT-LBW infants during 2 periods: from 0 to 5 mo postpartum (0-180 d postpartum) and from 6 to 12 mo postpartum (181-360 d postpartum) with the use of 48 clusters. All groups received the same general nutrition, health, and hygiene education (NHHE) at enrollment and throughout the 12 mo. Group assignments initially included the following 2 groups: no HS (control) group or HS from 0 to 5 mo postpartum. These assignments were followed by further divisions into the following 4 groups from 6 to 12 mo postpartum: 1) no HS and no MNP (control), 2) HS only, 3) MNP only, and 4) HS and MNP. RESULTS: When delivered in combination with NHHE, the use of an HS showed no additional benefit in reducing indicators of infection in the first or second half of infancy or the likelihood of stunting at 12 mo postpartum. FT-LBW infants who received the MNP (with or without the HS) were significantly less likely to be stunted at 12 mo than were controls (OR: 0.35; 95% CI: 0.15, 0.84; P = 0.017). CONCLUSIONS: The use of a mineral- and vitamin-enhanced MNP significantly reduced stunting in FT-LBW infants in this high-risk setting. The use of a water-based HS did not have an additive effect. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01455636.", "27146016": "Iron Regulation of Pancreatic Beta-Cell Functions and Oxidative Stress.\nDietary advice is the cornerstone in first-line treatment of metabolic diseases. Nutritional interventions directed at these clinical conditions mainly aim to (a) improve insulin resistance by reducing energy-dense macronutrient intake to obtain weight loss and (b) reduce fluctuations in insulin secretion through avoidance of rapidly absorbable carbohydrates. However, even in the majority of motivated patients selected for clinical trials, massive efforts using this approach have failed to achieve lasting efficacy. Less attention has been given to the role of micronutrients in metabolic diseases. Here, we review the evidence that highlights (a) the importance of iron in pancreatic beta-cell function and dysfunction in diabetes and (b) the integrative pathophysiological effects of tissue iron levels in the interactions among the beta cell, gut microbiome, hypothalamus, innate and adaptive immune systems, and insulin-sensitive tissues. We propose that clinical trials are warranted to clarify the impact of dietary or pharmacological iron reduction on the development of metabolic disorders.", "28298391": "Vitamin A supplementation redirects the flow of retinyl esters from peripheral to central organs of neonatal rats raised under vitamin A-marginal conditions.\nBackground: Vitamin A (VA; retinol) supplementation is used to reduce child mortality in countries with high rates of malnutrition. Existing research suggests that neonates (<1 mo old) may have a limited capacity to store VA in organs other than the liver; however, knowledge about VA distribution and kinetics in individual, nonhepatic organs is limited.Objective: We examined retinol uptake and turnover in nonhepatic organs, including skin, brain, and adipose tissue, in neonatal rats without and after VA supplementation.Design: Sprague-Dawley neonatal rats (n = 104) were nursed by mothers fed a VA-marginal diet (0.35 mg retinol/kg diet) and treated on postnatal day 4 with an oral dose of either VA (6 \u03bcg retinyl palmitate/g body weight) or canola oil (control), both containing 1.8 \u03bcCi of [3H]retinol. Subsequently, pups (n = 4 \u00b7 group-1 \u00b7 time-1) were killed at 13 different times from 30 min to 24 d after dosing. The fractional and absolute transfer of chylomicron retinyl esters (CM-REs), retinol bound to retinol-binding protein (RBP-ROH), and total retinol were estimated in WinSAAM software.Results: VA supplementation redirected the flow of CM-REs from peripheral to central organs and accumulated mainly in the liver. The RBP-ROH released from the liver was acquired mainly by the peripheral tissues but not retained efficiently, causing repeated recycling of retinol between plasma and tissues (541 compared with 5 times in the supplemented group and control group, respectively) and its rapid turnover in all organs, except the brain and white adipose tissue. Retinol stores in the liver lasted for \u223c2 wk before being gradually transferred to other organs.Conclusions: VA supplementation administered in a single high dose during the first month after birth is readily acquired but not retained efficiently in peripheral tissues of neonatal rats, suggesting that a more frequent, lower-dose supplementation may be necessary to maintain steady VA concentrations in rapidly developing neonatal tissues.", "27246320": "An overview of the effect of probiotics and exercise on mood and associated health conditions.\nThe present paper provides a review of the current knowledge relating to the health benefits of probiotics, specially focused on the effects they may have together with physical exercise on mood disorders and related chronic medical conditions.With both these conditions being a substantial contributor to the global disease burden, any alternative therapy must be considered. Probiotics influence the gut microbiota through a complex network of events which can influence mechanisms leading to development of mood disorders such as depression and anxiety. Similarly, through a complex interaction between psychological and neurobiological mechanisms, exercise has been found to play a key role in mood enhancement.", "26762373": "Dietary flavonoid intake and incidence of erectile dysfunction.\nBACKGROUND: The predominant etiology for erectile dysfunction (ED) is vascular, but limited data are available on the role of diet. A higher intake of several flavonoids reduces diabetes and cardiovascular disease risk, but no studies have examined associations between flavonoids and erectile function. OBJECTIVE: This study examined the relation between habitual flavonoid subclass intakes and incidence of ED. DESIGN: We conducted a prospective study among 25,096 men from the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study. Total flavonoid and subclass intakes were calculated from food-frequency questionnaires collected every 4 y. Participants rated their erectile function in 2000 (with historical reporting from 1986) and again in 2004 and 2008. RESULTS: During 10 y of follow-up, 35.6% reported incident ED. After multivariate adjustment, including classic cardiovascular disease risk factors, several subclasses were associated with reduced ED incidence, specifically flavones (RR = 0.91; 95% CI: 0.85, 0.97; P-trend = 0.006), flavanones (RR = 0.89; 95% CI: 0.83, 0.95; P-trend = 0.0009), and anthocyanins (RR = 0.91; 95% CI: 0.85, 0.98; P-trend = 0.002) comparing extreme intakes. The results remained statistically significant after additional adjustment for a composite dietary intake score. In analyses stratified by age, a higher intake of flavanones, anthocyanins, and flavones was significantly associated with a reduction in risk of ED only in men <70 y old and not older men (11-16% reduction in risk; P-interaction = 0.002, 0.03, and 0.007 for flavones, flavanones, and anthocyanins, respectively). In food-based analysis, higher total intake of fruit, a major source of anthocyanins and flavanones, was associated with a 14% reduction in risk of ED (RR = 0.86; 95% CI: 0.79, 0.92; P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that a higher habitual intake of specific flavonoid-rich foods is associated with reduced ED incidence. Intervention trials are needed to further examine the impact of increasing intakes of commonly consumed flavonoid-rich foods on men's health.", "28507013": "Mechanisms of Action of Probiotics and the Gastrointestinal Microbiota on Gut Motility and Constipation.\nConstipation is a common and burdensome gastrointestinal disorder that may result from altered gastrointestinal motility. The effect of probiotics on constipation has been increasingly investigated in both animal and human studies, showing promising results. However, there is still uncertainty regarding the mechanisms of action of probiotics on gut motility and constipation. Several factors are vital to normal gut motility, including immune and nervous system function, bile acid metabolism and mucus secretion, and the gastrointestinal microbiota and fermentation; an imbalance or dysfunction in any of these components may contribute to aberrant gut motility and, consequently, symptoms of constipation. For example, adults with functional constipation have significantly decreased numbers of bifidobacteria (with one study showing a mean difference of 1 log10/g) and lactobacilli (mean difference, 1.4 log10/g) in stool samples, as well as higher breath methane, compared with control subjects. Modifying the gut luminal environment with certain probiotic strains may affect motility and secretion in the gut and, hence, provide a benefit for patients with constipation. Therefore, this review explores the mechanisms through which probiotics may exert an effect on gut motility and constipation. Nevertheless, the majority of current evidence is derived from animal studies, and therefore, further human studies are needed to determine the mechanisms through specific probiotic strains that might be effective in constipation.", "28835366": "Vitamin D prenatal programming of childhood metabolomics profiles at age 3 y.\nBackground: Vitamin D deficiency is implicated in a range of common complex diseases that may be prevented by gestational vitamin D repletion. Understanding the metabolic mechanisms related to in utero vitamin D exposure may therefore shed light on complex disease susceptibility.Objective: The goal was to analyze the programming role of in utero vitamin D exposure on children's metabolomics profiles.Design: First, unsupervised clustering was done with plasma metabolomics profiles from a case-control subset of 245 children aged 3 y with and without asthma from the Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma Reduction Trial (VDAART), in which pregnant women were randomly assigned to vitamin D supplementation or placebo. Thereafter, we analyzed the influence of maternal pre- and postsupplement vitamin D concentrations on cluster membership. Finally, we used the metabolites driving the clustering of children to identify the dominant metabolic pathways that were influential in each cluster.Results: We identified 3 clusters of children characterized by 1) high concentrations of fatty acids and amines and low maternal postsupplement vitamin D (mean \u00b1 SD; 27.5 \u00b1 11.0 ng/mL), 2) high concentrations of amines, moderate concentrations of fatty acids, and normal maternal postsupplement vitamin D (34.0 \u00b1 14.1 ng/mL), and 3) low concentrations of fatty acids, amines, and normal maternal postsupplement vitamin D (35.2 \u00b1 15.9 ng/mL). Adjusting for sample storage time, maternal age and education, and both child asthma and vitamin D concentration at age 3 y did not modify the association between maternal postsupplement vitamin D and cluster membership (P = 0.0014). Maternal presupplement vitamin D did not influence cluster membership, whereas the combination of pre- and postsupplement concentrations did (P = 0.03).Conclusions: Young children can be clustered into distinct biologically meaningful groups by their metabolomics profiles. The clusters differed in concentrations of inflammatory mediators, and cluster membership was influenced by in utero vitamin D exposure, suggesting a prenatal programming role of vitamin D on the child's metabolome. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00920621."}
